I have developed a new manufacturing process and proposed it to be patented. An \gls{itp} was asked to the \gls{oepm} in order to get a first evaluation of the potential of the idea to be patented. The results of this report have been analysed by the \gls{upm} patent partner UNGRIA, which has forecasted a high probability to get the idea patented by the \gls{oepm}. Accordingly, the patent application is currently at the writing stage and is expected to be submitted in February with me (I.\,Lombardero) as the principal investigator.\\\vspace{1cm}
