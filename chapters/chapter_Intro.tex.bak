This chapter presents the thesis introduction.\\

The current scenario of the photovoltaic market is briefly reviewed, analysing the historical trends and future perspectives of the most important technologies.\\

This leads to the revision of the \soa{} of multijunction solar cells, on which this thesis focuses on. The three main approaches (new compound materials, metamorphic buffers and the wafer bonding technique) are analysed, summarizing their benefits and drawbacks.\\

The aforementioned revision set the basis to establish the thesis goals, which is devoted to enhancing the potential of multijunction solar cells by developing advanced architectures. One of the main pathways has been the traditional approach based on increasing the number of subcells, but other improvements such as the thinning of substrates or the use of graphene as a top contact have also been explored. Accordingly, a detailed explanation of the main objectives to be accomplished is provided.\\

Afterwards, the outline followed in the thesis to illustrate the work carried out is explained to ease the reader task of finding whatever required information.\\

Finally, the framework which has surrounded this thesis is described, accounting for the funding, the means provided by the group, colleagues or third party partners as well as the main achievements attained through this thesis.\\
