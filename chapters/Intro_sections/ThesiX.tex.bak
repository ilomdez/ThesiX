\section{About ThesiX}
ThesiX born during the redaction of my thesis. I found it difficult to find a \LaTeX{} template that eases the template build up while being easily extensible and customizable. Although there are some good works available, all of them fail to provide an out of the box template, easy to understand and modify without strong design constraints. My purpose is that this template will be use as the basis of any other work, modifying this template as necessary. Even if it is design to work as it is, all users are highly encourage to learn at least a basic \LaTeX{} and improve the template.

The template is available at 
y\=/   III\=/V Semiconductor Group was devoted to studying most approaches depicted in \tab\,\ref{tab:Intro_MJApproaches} in the framework of the \textit{ENARDECEL} project, which was the seed of this thesis. In particular, this thesis focused on the lattice\=/matched approach using dilute nitride materials to achieve 1\,eV subcells, as they are the ones with the best reported performance up to now (among lattice\=/matched materials). The lattice\=/mismatched approach has been studied within the thesis work of M. Hinojosa, a fellow Ph.D. student in the group, which is devoted to the development of inverted metamorphic subcells. 

The performance of solar cells based on dilute nitrides has been surpassed by lattice\=/mismatched technologies but it is still one of the workhorses to achieve high efficiencies due to the complex manufacture processes and thick buffer layers of the other approaches. However, what are the optimum growth conditions and whether a four\=/junction (4J) could possibly attain the requirements to achieve competitiveness was an open question at the beginning of this thesis. Therefore, one of the main objectives was to gather information about the different compositions available for dilute nitrides, their limitations and their potential. Once this was achieved, a four\=/junction device would be manufactured to test its potential for high\=/efficiency energy generation. The main aim of such a device would be to check whether the 45\=/50\,\% efficiency target could be attainable and under which circumstances.

The growth of dilute nitrides is of particular complexity, especially for \gls{movpe}\=/grown ones. Consequently, all of them have been provided by third\=/party growers with more extensive experience. The focus was set on learning from the material behaviour and provide valuable feedback for the growers to improve the solar cell performance. However, the grower partners must obviously protect their intellectual property and, even if the vast majority of the elemental information was shared, some structure or manufacturing details were unknown.

The performance of the Ge subcell was subsequently analysed to assess how much current it can provide and if certain processes, such as thinning it down, could improve its current generation. Furthermore, at this point of the thesis, the potential of multijunction solar cells for terrestrial generation started to lose interest, and the projects funding the dilute nitride development started having trouble (see \sect\,\ref{sec:Intro_Framework}). These issues reinforced the work thinning Ge subcells, focusing on the power per weight ratio and strengthen the focus on the space market or other niche markets with lightweight requirements.

Because the growth of dilute nitrides was carried out by third parties, it was inevitable to get stuck at certain points waiting for the next batches of samples. Therefore, the development of the three\=/dimensional (\gls{3d}) distributed model using equivalent circuits was carried out to keep improving the solar cell structures in those intervals. The simulation models were improved proposing new ways to decrease the series resistance losses in solar cells, analyse their reliability and enhance the understanding of the certain effects, such as those provoked by leakage currents. Such a transversal objective has taken place along the whole thesis.
  
In summary, the main objectives addressed throughout this thesis have been:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To build up and consolidate a strong background and know\=/how on dilute nitrides in the group, checking different compositions and growth techniques. This will allow to simulate their performance and optimize multijunction solar cell structures, with the ultimate goal of manufacturing a 4J device on top of a Ge substrate incorporating dilute nitrides.
	\item To analyse the performance of the Ge subcell as a function of the substrate thickness, with special emphasis on its current generation inside a 3J, to enhance its power-to-weight ratio.
	\item To improve the \gls{3d} distributed model, assessing new metallizations systems, the solar cell reliability or the influence of leakage currents on its performance.
\end{enumerate}
