\chapter*{Resumen} \markboth{Resumen}{}
Resumen means Abstract in Spanish, but obviously it should be replaced by the corresponding word in the mother tongue of the author. In my opinion, this should be always before the Abstract, as probably the acknowledgements will be mostly written in the author's mother tongue. Therefore it make sense to put these two sections together, and leave the Abstract closer to the rest of the document which will be probably written in English. In any case this depends on the personal view of the user.
