abstract = {The influence of shunts on multijunction solar cells cannot be directly extrapolated from their effect on single junction solar cells. We show that the rules of thumb for single junction solar cells can mislead to wrong diagnosis on multijunction solar cells when they are only partially shunted. In order to properly assess their performance, three dimensional simulations have been carried out using equivalent electrical circuits. The differences between completely and partially shunted multijunction solar cells under different regimes are pointed out and the use of dark I–V curves and electroluminescence as valid tools to detect the existence of shunts are evaluated. A straightforward application of this work is its use in reliability analysis, allowing an undoubtedly identification of shunts at both, the solar cell manufacture and on-field operation.},

In this preliminary study, the Ge subcell is observed to suffer about 15{\%} Jsc drop and {\~{}}50 mV Voc loss at 1-sun, while the Voc of the GaNAsSb subcell drops by as much as {\~{}} 140 mV. The degradation of the Ge and GaNAsSb subcells in the current-matched 4J structure can hinder its efficiency potential to a higher extent than in the GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge 3J.

@article{Barrutia2019,
abstract = {Graphene has been intensively studied in photovoltaics focusing on emerging solar cells based on thin films, dye‐sensitized solar cells, quantum dots, nanowires, and so forth. However, the typical efficiency of these solar cells incorporating graphene is below 16{\%}. Therefore, the photovoltaic potential of graphene has not yet been shown. In this work, the use of graphene for concentration applications on III‐V multijunction solar cells, which indeed are the solar cells with the highest efficiency, is demonstrated. First, a wide optoelectronic characterization of graphene layers is carried out. Then, the graphene layer is incorporated onto triple‐junction solar cells, which decreases their series resistance by 35{\%} (relative), leading to an increase in fill factor of 4{\%} (absolute) at concentrations of 1000 suns. Simultaneously, the optical absorption of graphene produces a relative short‐circuit current density decrease in the range of 0{\%} to 1.8{\%}. As a result, an absolute efficiency improvement close to 1{\%} at concentrations of 1000 suns was achieved with respect to triple‐junction solar cells without graphene. The impact of incorporating one and two graphene mono- layers},

Technology Computer Aided Design modeling is used to examine the performance under light concentration of a 4-J solar cell Ge-based that includes a 1-eV MBE-grown dilute nitride subcell. The 1-eV solar cell is modeled and examined by using material parameters extracted from detailed electro-optical characterization prior to be included into a multijunction structure. The modelling reveals the impact of the electric field-assisted collection in the performance of single junction solar cells and its effect when included in a 4-Junction solar cells. This effect is responsible for the lower FF (∼15{\%} lower) in the 4J when including the dilute nitride subcell, especially if it limits the photocurrent. Finally, an optimization procedure based on dilute nitrides with higher material quality is performed resulting in a 4-Junction solar cell with an efficiency of 47{\%} for concentrations between 1000-2000 suns direct terrestrial spectrum.},

@article{Navarro2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Minerals, Metals  {\&}  Materials Society The effects of ex situ annealing in N ambient and in situ annealing in As ambient on GaNSbAs/GaAs structures grown by molecular beam epitaxy were investigated by low temperature cross-sectional cathodoluminescence (CL). The amount and distribution of Sb was measured by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The cross-sectional CL analysis of all samples reveals a shift of the near band edge (NBE) emission along the growth axis, presumably associated with a non-uniform incorporation of Sb during the growth process, in agreement with the Sb distribution measured by EDS in the as-grown sample. The NBE emission in the annealed samples presents a redshift with respect to the as-grown sample. This effect might be explained by a redistribution/activation of N in the GaNSbAs lattice since the Sb distribution measured by EDS does not reveal significant changes, within the error margin, with respect to the as-grown sample. The in situ annealed in the As overpressure sample shows the best properties for solar cells applications, i.e., a NBE peak position close to 1.0 eV and the lowest full width at half maximum of this emission.},
