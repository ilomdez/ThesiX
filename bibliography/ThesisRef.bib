abstract = {The performance of a GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAs solar cell incorporating AlInP moth eye antireflection coating is reported and compared with the performance of a similar cell comprising TiO2/SiO2 antireflection coating. The moth eye coating exhibits an average reflectance of only 2{\%} within the spectral range from 400 nm to 1600 nm. EQE measurements revealed absorption-related losses in the AlInP moth eye coating at wavelengths below 510 nm. Short wavelength absorption decreases the current generation in the top GaInP junction by 10{\%}. Despite the absorption losses, the moth eye patterned GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAs solar cell exhibited higher current generation under AM1.5G real sun illumination.},

@article{Shan1999,
abstract = {We present evidence for a strong interaction between the conduction band and a narrow resonant band formed by nitrogen states in Ga 12x In x N y As 12y alloys. The interaction leads to a splitting of the conduction band into two subbands and a reduction of the fundamental band gap. An anticrossing of the extended states of the conduction band of the Ga 12x In x As matrix and the localized nitrogen resonant states is used to model the interaction. Optical transitions associated with the energy minima of the two subbands and the characteristic anticrossing behavior of the transitions under applied hydrostatic pressure have been unambiguously observed using photomodulation spectroscopy. The experimental results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the model. [S0031-9007(98)08364-1] PACS numbers: 71.20.Nr, 62.50. + p, 78.20. – e Semiconductor alloys containing component elements with distinctly different properties are currently attracting significant attention. In particular, intensive experimental [1–7] and theoretical [8–12] efforts have recently been di-rected towards developing an understanding of the proper-ties of group III-N-V alloys in which the group-V element is partially replaced by nitrogen. It has been found that in-corporating low concentrations of N has a profound effect on the electronic properties of these materials. A reduction of the band gap exceeding 0.1 eV per atomic percent of N content was observed in GaN x As 12x for x , 0.015 [1]. This discovery has opened an interesting possibility of us-ing N containing alloys for long wavelength optoelectronic devices [13]. It also raises an important question as to the mechanism responsible for this unusual behavior. Model calculations of the band structure of some of the group III-N-V alloys have shown that the reduction of the band gap is due to the highly localized nature of the perturbation intro-duced by N atoms [8–12,14]. The largest contributions to the band gap reduction originate from structural relaxation and charge exchange that are, respectively, proportional to the differences in the atomic orbital size and energy of the As and N atoms [8,11]. It is well known that at very low concentrations N intro-duces a highly localized acceptorlike level in conventional III-V compound semiconductors. In GaP the level is lo-cated slightly below the conduction band minimum. Ex-trapolation of the data obtained for GaAsP alloys suggests the level is located at about 0.3 eV above the bottom of the conduction band in GaAs [15]. This has been confirmed by measurements of hydrostatic pressure dependent pho-toluminescence spectra that have shown an emergence of N bound excitons at a pressure of about 2.3 GPa [16,17]. In this Letter, we show that the incorporation of N into GaInAs alloys leads to a strong interaction between the conduction band and a narrow resonant band formed by the N states due to the highly localized nature of the perturba-tion introduced by N atoms, resulting in a splitting of the conduction band and a reduction of the fundamental band gap. This is supported by the unambiguous observations of the optical transitions associated with the two branches of the split lowest conduction band in Ga 12x In x N y As 12y alloy samples with different In and N concentrations and a characteristic anticrossing behavior of the two branches under hydrostatic pressure. The observed reduction of the band gap energy of Ga 12x In x N y As 12y alloys with small N concentration can be fully explained by this interaction. The Ga 12x In x N y As 12y epitaxial layers used in this work were grown on GaAs substrates by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy using dimethylhydrazine as the nitrogen source. Layers were grown at 5 mm͞h and 570 580},

abstract = {This work focuses on the characterization of 1.0 eV GaInNAsSb solar cells for application to the high efficiency multijunction solar cells. In the multijunction scheme such as GaInP / GaAs / GaInNAsSb and GaInP / GaAs / GaInNAsSb / Ge, the thickness of the GaInNAsSb absorber should be thicker than 2 ?m to ensure optimal amount of current generation matched to those of the other subcells. In this study, 1.0 eV GaInNAsSb thin films and solar cells grown by molecular beam epitaxy were investigated. For the purpose of improving the material quality, post-growth annealing was applied. After the annealing, photoluminescence efficiency together with the carrier recombination rate was found improved. The spectral responses in external quantum efficiency measurements at wavelengths longer than 870 nm increased with increasing the GaInNAsSb thicknesses, and reaches close to 90{\%} for the 2.0 ?m-thick device. In order to characterize further the multijunction solar cell properties, the 2.0 ?m device was mechanically connected with a GaInP / GaAs dual-junction cell in series. The light I-V measurement was carried out and 25.9{\%} of efficiency was achieved for the mechanically connected triple-junction structure under the AM-1.5 spectrum},

abstract = {In this work, lattice-matched 3-junction and 4-junction solar cells including the dilute nitride subcells were fabricated by a hybrid growth technique of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). It was found that photocarrier extraction in the MBE grown dilute nitride GaInNAsSb subcells degraded after the overgrowth of the upper subcells by MOCVD. Then, we focused on the effect of annealing for a set of MBE grown GaInNAsSb single junction solar cells annealed in the MOCVD reactor under an arsine flow ambient. It was found that degradation of the carrier extraction due to the MOCVD growth ambient is in a correlation with the selective hydrogen incorporation into the GaInNAsSb layers. We demonstrated that the subsequent annealing in nitrogen ambient promoted the outdiffusion of hydrogen which led to a recovery of the GaInNAsSb solar cell performances.},

This paper reviews previous work related to process monitoring by luminescence imaging techniques and discusses some recent progress in the areas of several experimental and theoretical aspects of luminescence imaging. It is shown that luminescence imaging is an exceptionally versatile tool that provides spatially resolved information about a variety of material and solar cell parameters with data acquisition times that are compatible with in-line process monitoring.},

abstract = {We have investigated deep-level defects in InGaAsN/GaAs 3xQW structures by means of conventional as well as high-resolution deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). The three samples were grown by atmospheric pressure metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (AP-MOVPE) in different growth temperatures (566 degrees C, 575 degrees C and 585 degrees C). The DLTS measurements revealed four electron traps E1 (0.17-0.24 eV), E2 (0.36-0.38 eV), E3 (0.46-0.49 eV) and E4 (0.81-0.84 eV) and one hole trap H1(0.8 eV) in our structures. The electron trap E1 was associated with N-related complexes while the other electron traps with native defects, usually observed in GaAs-based structures EL6, EL3 and EL2, respectively. Finally, the trap E2 and H1, observed in the structure grown at lowest temperature, were associated with the same trap, which can act as both an electron and hole trap. It was thus concluded that E2/H1 may be a generation-recombination center.},

abstract = {Previous calculations suggested low-equilibrium N solubility in bulk GaAs. In epitaxial growth, however, N solubility can be significantly enhanced to as much as a few {\%}. First-principles total-energy calculations show that this large difference is due to the lack of low-energy nucleation sites of GaN during epitaxy. As a result, the atomic chemical potential of N can be significantly larger. This gives rise to new defect physics distinctly different from those in GaAs. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Multijunction solar cells have proven to be capable of extremely high efficiencies by combining multiple semiconductor materials with bandgaps tuned to the solar spectrum. Reaching the optimum set of semiconductors often requires combining high-quality materials with different lattice constants into a single device, a challenge particularly suited for metamorphic epitaxy. In this article, we describe different approaches to metamorphic multijunction solar cells, including traditional upright metamorphic, state-of-the-art inverted metamorphic, and forward-looking multijunction designs on silicon. We also describe the underlying materials science of graded buffers that enables metamorphic subcells with low dislocation densities. Following nearly two decades of research, recent efforts have demonstrated high-quality lattice-mismatched multijunction solar cells with very little performance loss related to the mismatch, enabling solar-to-electric conversion efficiencies over 45{\%}.},

The modelling reveals the impact of the electric field-assisted collection in the performance of single junction solar cells and its effect when included in a 4-Junction solar cells. This effect is responsible for the lower FF ({\~{}}15{\%} lower) in the 4J when including the dilute nitride subcell, especially if it limits the photocurrent. Finally, an optimization procedure based on dilute nitrides with higher material quality is performed resulting in a 4-Junction solar cell with an efficiency of 47{\%} for concentrations between 1000-2000 suns direct terrestrial spectrum.},

abstract = {While being of persistent interest for the integration of lattice-matched laser devices with silicon circuits, the electronic structure of dilute nitride III/V-semiconductors has presented a challenge to ab initio computational approaches. The root of this lies in the strong distortion N atoms exert on most host materials. Here, we resolve these issues by combining density functional theory calculations based on the meta-GGA functional presented by Tran and Blaha (TB09) with a supercell approach for the dilute nitride Ga(NAs). Exploring the requirements posed to supercells, we show that the distortion field of a single N atom must be allowed to decrease so far, that it does not overlap with its periodic images. This also prevents spurious electronic interactions between translational symmetric atoms, allowing to compute band gaps in very good agreement with experimentally derived reference values. These results open up the field of dilute nitride compound semiconductors to predictive ab initio calculations.},

abstract = {An improved photocurrent production is demonstrated in dilute nitride GaInNAsSb solar cells grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The photovoltaic properties were investigated by increasing the thickness of GaInNAsSb layers from 1.0 to 3.0 $\mu$m. The amount of photon absorption increased with increasing thickness. Yet an incomplete photocarrier collection was observed in the 2.0- and 3.0-$\mu$m-thick GaInNAsSb devices. This feature is due to a partial lack of electric field in the GaInNAsSb region. In order for complete carrier collection aided by the electric field, the background-doping level should be as low as {\~{}}1014cm?3 in a thick undoped-GaInNAsSb absorption layer. Here, the effectiveness of annealing on improving the field-assisted carrier collection is shown. This is ascribed to a decrease of the background doping in the GaInNAsSb layer. In a properly designed device for a 1.0-eV GaInNAsSb cell, it is demonstrated that the external quan- tum efficiency can reach as high as 90{\%} at wavelengths longer than the GaAs bandgap.},

abstract = {(Ga,In)(N,As) lattice matched to GaAs with a band gap of 1 eV is employed as active material in high-efficiency III-V solar cells. Te-doped Ga0.934In0.066N0.023As0.977 layers were grown by metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy on (1 0 0) GaAs. The samples were highly doped n-type with carrier concentrations ranging from about 1017-1019 cm-3. Pieces of the samples were hydrogenated with H-doses of 1018 ion/cm2. The optical and electrical properties of the samples before and after hydrogenation were studied by low-temperature photoluminescence and magnetotransport. In undoped samples hydrogen is known to form N-H complexes which strongly reduce the local perturbation of the lattice due to nitrogen and thus reverse the N-induced global changes of the band structure. Combined analysis of photoluminescence and transport measurements on Te-doped samples, however, indicates a competition between N-H formation and passivation of the Te donor favoring the latter. Hardly any band structure changes due to hydrogenation are observed in these Te-doped samples, instead a strong reduction of the free-carrier concentration is observed after hydrogenation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {GaNAsSb/GaAs quantum wells were grown by solid-source molecular-beam epitaxy utilizing a radio-frequency nitrogen plasma source. The GaNAsSb layers, originally the quantum well barrier materials for GaInNAs(Sb) devices, were studied for their general growth characteristics as well as their structural and optical properties, which give an indication of its quality as a quantum well barrier material. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction, high-resolution x-ray diffraction, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were used to study those properties. The growth parameters including arsenic overpressure and substrate temperature were changed systematically to determine the properties during deposition and to optimize these conditions. It was found that the addition of antimony to GaNAs did not improve the material as it did for GaInNAs. PL measurements indicated a decreasing optical quality with an increasing substrate temperature and no change with the arsenic overpressure. In addition, the addition of antimony had eliminated the lattice-strain compensation provided by the GaNAs barriers. Using GaNAs rather than GaNAsSb barriers in the GaInNAs(Sb) devices was found to be advantageous and has dramatically improved the performance of long-wavelength GaAs-based lasers.

abstract = {Capacitance spectroscopy is used to examine the compositional dependence of deep levels in Si-doped Ga(As,N) layers grown on GaAs. We find two predominant electron traps at about 0.80 and 1.1 eV above the valence band edge E-V, which do not depend on composition. For N contents above 0.1{\%} N, the concentration of the acceptor-like gap level at E-V+1.1 eV strongly increases and leads to a distinct reduction of the donor doping efficiency in Ga(As,N) layers. Based on theoretical prediction, this electron trap is tentatively associated with a split interstitial defect containing a nitrogen and an arsenic atom on the same As lattice site {\{}[{\}}(AsN)(As)]. The trap at E-V+0.80 eV likely corresponds to nitrogen dimers, i.e., two N atoms on a single As site {\{}[{\}}(NN)(As)]. When approaching the critical layer thickness, this electron trap is increasingly generated during growth. The dimer defect can be removed by rapid thermal annealing at 720 degreesC after growth, in contrast to the stable bulk level at E-V+1.1 eV. By the formation of both N-related defects, the tensile strain in Ga(As,N) is reduced. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

Concentrated light current-voltage characteristics of three GaInNAsSb-based solar cells with various thicknesses of GaInNAsSb layers (ti) from 1.0 to 3.0$\mu$m were evaluated. The photogenerated carriers from the GaInNAsSb layers are well collected even for the ti = 2.0 and 3.0$\mu$m devices. The comparison of the solar cell parameters under high concentration conditions showed no significant difference among the devices. This behavior is consistent with the results of series resistance analyses. This suggests that the bulk resistance due to the GaInNAsSb thickness is a minor factor for the series resistance in the present devices.},

abstract = {The thermal annealing of nitrogen related traps in p-type InGaAsN and GaAsN is investigated by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). Upon annealing, an apparent recovery of the photovoltaic properties correlates with changes in the DLTS data observed for InGaAsN and GaAsN diodes and solar cells, revealing that a nitrogen related E1 (E-C-0.20 eV) center has an important role in governing the solar cell performance. The large electron capture cross section (similar to 8.9x10(-15) cm(2)) of this center indicates that this defect may act as an efficient recombination center. Therefore, its complete removal by annealing or by some other process is essential for the high performance of GaInAsN solar cells. The internal quantum efficiency data were modeled to quantify the change in material properties associated with this improvement upon annealing. Annealed cells with indium impurity (InGaAsN) show a slightly higher photoresponse, which could be due to low scattering caused by In-N pair formation after annealing.

abstract = {(GaIn)(NAs)/GaAs multi-quantum-well heterostructures are grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy at low temperatures and are subsequently annealed in the reactor to optimize optoelectronic properties. Detailed optical and structural studies of the properties of the material, which change upon annealing under different As-stabilization as well as at different temperatures, reveal that there are two major effects of the anneal. The first one is the blue-shift of the fundamental band gap of the material, which can be attributed to a local change in the group-III environment of the nitrogen atoms. The second observation is a strong increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity and decrease in PL linewidth upon anneal in H2-ambient, which can be attributed to the removal of non-radiative defects in the material. Chain-like N-ordering in growth direction, which induces strong inhomogeneous strain fields in the material and which can be dissolved upon anneal in H2-ambient might also act as one of the main non-radiative recombination centers in the (GaIn)(NAs) material system.},

abstract = {Free-form solar cells are cells of unconventional shapes (e.g. hexagonal, leaf-shaped etc). Their flexible shape adds to the aesthetics of the surroundings as well as allows to place them over objects where conventional solar cells might not fit. Evidently, these cells need to be efficient as well, and one of the important factors that controls their performance is the front metallization design. In this paper, we present the application of topology optimization (TO) to optimize the front metallization patterns for free-form solar cells. TO distributes the electrode material on the solar cell front surface in an efficient manner, such that the total power output is maximized. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed methodology, we use it to optimize front metal grids for several complex solar cell shapes e.g. circular, hexagonal, leaf-shaped, motorbike fairings, etc. The results presented here demonstrate the capability of TO to generate efficient designs for these free-form shapes.},

State-of-the-art monolithic two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem devices have so far featured silicon bottom cells that are polished on their front side to be compatible with the perovskite fabrication process. This concession leads to higher potential production costs, higher reflection losses and non-ideal light trapping. To tackle this issue, we developed a top cell deposition process that achieves the conformal growth of multiple compounds with controlled optoelectronic properties directly on the micrometre-sized pyramids of textured monocrystalline silicon. Tandem devices featuring a silicon heterojunction cell and a nanocrystalline silicon recombination junction demonstrate a certified steady-state efficiency of 25.2{\%}. Our optical design yields a current density of 19.5 mA cm−2 thanks to the silicon pyramidal texture and suggests a path for the realization of 30{\%} monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices.},

abstract = {The congruent evaporation temperature Tc of GaAs (001) is critical for many technological processes and is fundamental to the control and stability of Ga droplets for quantum structure fabrication. We apply the technique of local droplet etching (LDE) to measure Tc for technologically important molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown GaAs (001). Below Tc , Ga droplets deposited on the surface shrink and form nanoholes via LDE and thermal widening. Above Tc , droplets grow by capturing excess Ga. From the transition between both regimes, we determine Tc = 680 ± 10 °C. Additionally, we find that the nanohole/droplet densities follow an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence with an activation energy of 1.31 eV. The method probes the stability of pre-existing droplets formed by deposition and so avoids the complication of nucleation barriers and readily allows the measurement of Tc for technologically important planar GaAs surfaces in any standard MBE system.},

Different solar cell technologies are analyzed comprising state-of-the-art Ge solar cells with a highly doped p = 1×10 17 cm -3 base layer. Additionally, a set of rear-side passivated Ge solar cells with different base layer doping concentrations in the range of p= 1-4×10 16 cm -3 are investigated. These structures benefit from an increased current-density which results from significantly larger diffusions lengths.Thus, carriers which are generated through the indirect absorption transition deep in the bulk material are able to diffuse to the front-side pn-junction. Measurements are presented showing that the quantum efficiency related to the direct and indirect absorption transition of the Ge solar cell is differently affected by electron irradiation. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Due to its 1 eV band gap and GaAs-matched lattice constant, GaInNAs has long been considered for use in four-junction multi-junction solar cells; but, material quality issues have impeded its use in highly efficient devices. Here, we present an analysis of GaInNAs samples partially hydrogenated via a UV-activated process in which nitrogen-related alloy fluctuations, impurities, and defects have been passivated; remarkably, removing completely the 's-shape' dependence of the photoluminescence while keeping intact the effects of nitrogen substitution, i.e., the band gap of the alloy prior to passivation. Hydrogenation of the optical samples by a UV-activated process has resulted in GaInNAs photoluminescence dominated by the free-excitonic band gap transition, rather than radiative recombination processes from the shallow localized centers that result due to unavoidable alloy fluctuations. This behavior is unique since these centers dominate the low temperature photoluminescence even in the highest quality dilute nitrides. Density functional theory calculations show that the hydrogenation of the N and Ga atoms eliminates the defect levels from the band gap through the formation of H–N centers that act as donors; while at high concentration of hydrogen, Ga–H 2 –N complexes reside within the continuum. The formation of these hydrogen complexes, along with the incumbent change of the band structure, explains the reduction of emission from the localized centers upon hydrogenation.},

abstract = {III/V semiconductors containing small amounts of Nitrogen (N) are very interesting for a variety of optoelectronic applications. Unfortunately, the conventionally used N precursor 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMHy) has an extremely low N incorporation efficiency in GaAs when grown using metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. Alloying Ga(NAs) with Indium (In) even leads to an exponential reduction of N incorporation. The huge amount of UDMHy in turn changes drastically the growth conditions. Furthermore, the application of this material is still hampered by the large carbon incorporation, most probably originating from the metal organic precursors. Hence, novel precursors for dilute nitride growth are needed. This paper will show (GaIn)(NAs) growth studies with the novel precursor di-tertiary-butyl-arsano-amine in combination with tri-ethyl-gallium and tri-methyl-indium. We show an extremely high N incorporation efficiency in the In containing (GaIn)(NAs). The (GaIn)(NAs) samples investigated in this study have been examined using high resolution X-Ray diffraction, room temperature photoluminescence and atomic force microscope measurements as well as secondary ion mass spectrometry.},

The method is applied to single- and four-junction solar cells containing {\~{}}1.0 eV dilute nitride material. We find that luminescent coupling increases the short-circuit current (JSC) of the 1-junction dilute nitride cell by 2.4{\%} due to coupling with the Al0.05Ga0.95As filter. In the 4-junction design, there is significant photon recycling within the GaAs and GaInP sub-cells, providing a 60 mV increase in open-circuit voltage. There is a 1.9{\%} relative increase in calculated efficiency to 44.4{\%}.},

@article{Sterzer2016,
abstract = {III/V semiconductors containing small amounts of nitrogen (N; dilute nitrides) are discussed in the context of different solar cell and laser applications. The efficiency of these devices is negatively affected by carbon (C) incorporation, which comes either from the direct C–N bond in the N precursor unsymmetrical 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMHy) used conventionally or from the alkyl groups of the conventional precursors for gallium (Ga), indium and arsenic (As) containing carbon. This C is incorporated together with the N due to the strength of the C–N bond. A further important issue in dilute nitride growth is the very low N incorporation efficiency in the crystal from UDMHy, which can be as little as 1{\%} of the N supplied in the gas phase. Therefore, new metal organic chemicals have to be synthesized and their growth characteristics and suitability for dilute nitride growth have to be explored. This work presents the chemical di-tertiary-butyl-arsano-amine (DTBAA), which was synthesized, purified and tested as an N precursor for metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Computational investigations show $\beta$-hydrogen and isobutane elimination to be the main reaction channel in the gas phase with high reaction barriers and absence of small fragments containing C as products. The loss of N via N2, as in UDMHy, can be excluded for unimolecular reactions of DTBAA. The Ga(NAs)/GaAs heterostructures were grown by MOVPE as initial test material and a systematic N incorporation study is presented in this paper. It is shown that high quality Ga(NAs) can be grown using DTBAA. The N incorporation was confirmed by high resolution X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence studies. All samples grown exhibit as grown room temperature photoluminescence and smooth surface morphologies. Furthermore, DTBAA shows extremely high N incorporation efficiency, which makes this molecule a very promising candidate for further research into dilute nitride material growth.},

The composition determination method is based on combining x-ray diffractometry and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy measurements. The modified band anti-crossing model was derived from the model known for GaInNAs and using band-gap composition relations for GaInAs, GaInSb, InAsSb and GaAsSb. The model parameters were defined by fitting with experimental bandgap data retrieved from photoluminescence. For validation and data fitting we used experimental samples with N composition in the range of 0–0.06, In composition from 0 to 0.17, and Sb composition in the range of 0–0.08. All samples were thermally annealed to minimize the band gap shift caused by the short range ordering effects in GaInNAsSb crystal.

abstract = {This paper deals with the determination of the main factors influencing series resistance in p-on-n GaAs solar cells working at concentration levels of 1000 suns or higher. Prior to this analysis, a comparison between different front metal grid geometries is presented to show the strong influence that the front grid component of series resistance exerts on its global value. Once the inverted square grid geometry is selected, a detailed analysis of the different components of series resistance is carried out. For this purpose, a multidimensional optimisation of the whole GaAs solar cell (antireflecting coatings, series resistance and semiconductor structure) has been used for the first time. In order to orient the manufacture of very high concentrator GaAs solar cells, recommendations on the threshold values of solar cell size, specific p- and n-contact resistances, thickness of the front metal grid and both doping level and thickness of the substrate are formulated. Several traditional ideas on the influence of these parameters are questioned. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We have investigated a possibility of the site-controlled InGaAsN epitaxy by using a new source material of hexakis-diethylamido-diindium ([In{\{}N(C2H5)2{\}}3]2). In the site-controlled epitaxy of the InGaAsN layer, the N atoms should be incorporated randomly and should also preferentially form In-N bonds during growth. The new source has been developed to satisfy these two requirements for the site-controlled epitaxy. Single-crystalline InN layer has been successfully obtained on a nitrided $\alpha$-Al2O3 substrate by supplying only a [In{\{}N(C2H5)2{\}}3]2 beam. Polycrystalline InNAs has also been obtained on a nitrided $\alpha$-Al2O3 substrate by [In{\{}N(C2H5)2{\}}3]2 and an As4 beam supplied simultaneously. Furthermore, phase separation into GaAs and InN phases has been observed in the layers grown under simultaneous irradiation of Ga, As4 and [In{\{}N(C2H5)2{\}}3]2 beams on a nitrided $\alpha$-Al2O3 substrate. The results strongly indicate that site-controlled epitaxy can be expected to be achieved by using new source materials, such as [In{\{}N(C2H5)2{\}}3]2 that can produce the In-N fragments efficiently. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Dilute nitride films with a roughly 1 eV band gap can be lattice-matched to gallium arsenide and germanium, and therefore could become a critical component in next-generation multijunction solar cells. To date most dilute nitride solar cells have been plagued with poor efficiency, due in large part to short diffusion lengths. This study focuses on two techniques aimed at improving the quality of dilute nitride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy: the utilization of biased deflection plates installed in front of the nitrogen plasma source, and the introduction of antimony during growth. Results from GaInNAs cells grown with and without deflection plates, and GaInNAsSbsolar cells are reported. The use of biased deflection plates during GaInNAs growth improved every aspect of solar cell performance. For the GaInNAs devices grown with deflection plates, the dark current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor were the best of the devices studied. The GaInNAsSb cells had the highest quantum efficiency, almost 80 {\%} at maximum, mainly due to low background doping densities providing these devices with wide depletion widths. The GaInNAsSb materials also had quite narrow band gaps of 0.92 eV. Because of the high collection efficiency coupled with the narrow band gap, the sub-GaAs short-circuit current density produced by the GaInNAsSb cells is 14.8 mA ∕ cm 2 , which was the highest of the devices studied. This current is nearly 50 {\%} greater than the best dilute nitride solar cells in the literature, and is the first dilute nitride cell to produce enough current to current match the upper two subcells in a triple-junction device, composed of GaInP/InGaAs/GaInNAsSb.},

abstract = {Luminescent coupling in multijunction solar cells is the phenomenon in which a junction in forward bias radiates photons that are absorbed in and converted to photocurrent by the junction beneath the radiating one. This effect can be significant in modern high-efficiency multijunction cells. We have previously developed a combined measurement and analytical approach to characterize the short-circuit current including the effects of nonlinear coupling in terms of measurable parameters $\eta$ and $\phi$ that describe the coupling strength and linearity, respectively. Here, we develop an analytical model for the full current-voltage characteristic V (J) of a multijunction cell in the presence of luminescent coupling, in terms of the $\eta$ and $\phi$ parameters. We compare the model with the measured V (J) parameters of GaInP/GaAs two-junction cells that exhibit differing degrees of luminescent coupling, and show that the model well describes the measurements. We then use the model to explore the consequences of luminescent coupling on the operating parameters of an idealized two-junction cell as a function of the top-junction thickness, focusing on the open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and efficiency. The results demonstrate that the strong luminescent coupling can significantly alter the dependence of cell efficiency on junction thickness, and that consequently the well-known optical-thinning design rules must be modified.},

abstract = {A method for the determination of N distribution in dilute nitride GaAsSbN superlattices (SLs) by using different STEM imaging settings is proposed. The method combines the simultaneous acquisition under Low Angle (LA-) and High Angle (HA-) Annular Dark Field (ADF) conditions by exploiting two different dedicated angle intervals. On one hand, HAADF technique gives information that principally depends on the atomic number (Sb sensitive) and on the other hand, N atoms produce high static atomic displacements affecting the image intensity especially under LAADF conditions. However, the simultaneous presence of Sb and N supposes an important handicap to differentiate both elements. N distribution maps could be obtained from suitable normalization and the separation of the intensity ratios in regions with/without Sb. Semi-quantitative maps are also available by combination of the results from high-resolution X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy techniques. Type-I (GaAsSbN/GaAs) and type-II (GaAsSb/GaAsN) SL structures are evaluated using the proposed methodology. Differences in the N distribution between both samples such as inhomogeneities and cluster formation are discussed. Specifically, we have found a greater number of N-rich regions in type-I structure as compared to their type-II counterparts, which could have an influence on the optical response of each design.},

Carrier lifetime measurements are crucial in optimizing material growth and p-i-n field-aided carrier-extraction-device design. One research group has reported carrier lifetimes of MBE-grown bulk InGaNAsSb materials, but there has been no report of carrier lifetime measurements from bulk InGaNAsSb grown by MOVPE. In this study, we report the growth of bulk InGaNAsSb by MOVPE and the first carrier lifetime measurement from MOVPE-grown bulk InGaNAsSb materials with E-g = 1.0 - 1.2eV at 300K. We studied carrier dynamics in MOVPE-grown bulk dilute nitride materials nominally lattice matched to GaAs (100) substrates: 1 mu m thick In0.035GaN0.025As (E-g = 1.0eV at 300K) and similar to 0.2 mu m thick In(0.05-0.07)GaN(0.01-0.02)AsSb(0.02-0.06) layers (E-g = 1.2eV at 300K). Both structures are fully strained. The incorporation of N in InGaNAs leads to degradation in photoluminescence efficiency, but prior studies indicate the addition of Sb in MBE-grown InGaNAsSb improved the PL efficiency. Two-step post-growth thermal annealing processes were optimized to obtain maximum PL efficiencies that yielded a typical blue shift of 50 and 30meV for InGaNAs and InGaNAsSb, respectively. We employed a streak camera to measure carrier lifetimes from both as-grown and thermally annealed samples. Carrier lifetimes of {\textless}30psec were obtained from the InGaNAs samples, whereas carrier lifetimes of up to similar to 150psec were obtained from the InGaNAsSb samples. We discuss possible reasons for short carrier lifetimes measured from MOVPE-grown InGaNAs(Sb) materials.},

abstract = {The effect of oxygen on the degradation of inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) blends has been investigated by monitoring current-voltage (jV)-curves, impedance spectra and charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) traces during the degradation process. The use of gas permeable top electrodes allows monitoring the kinetics of degradation without being limited by the diffusion through a compact metal electrode. A computational model is used to provide a phenomenological explanation of the experimental results. The charge distribution inside the device is modeled by solving the fully coupled set of nonlinear differential equations for the quasi-one-dimensional transport of electrons and holes. Degradation of the cells in the presence of oxygen results mainly in the reduction of short circuit current (jsc), while the concomitant loss in light absorption is negligible. The rate of degradation is enhanced significantly by illumination. A significant part of the loss in jsc is reversible upon annealing under nitrogen or in vacuum. The irreversible part of the degradation is assigned to the photochemical formation of carbonyl and carboxylic groups, which act as traps for electrons. The reversible component of degradation is due to p-doping of the photoactive layer by oxygen, which results in the formation of mobile holes and immobile superoxide anions. This leads to the formation of a space charge region in front of the electron extracting electrode whose width depends on the doping level as well as on the applied bias. The space charge region shields the electric field inside the photoactive layer and hence hampers charge carrier extraction, which leads to the observed loss in short circuit current. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We show a strong relationship between CuPt atomic ordering and misfit dislocation glide plane preference during strain relaxation. A miscut substrate creates an asymmetry in the resolved mismatch stress between {\{}111{\}} glide planes, causing a preference for one glide plane that results in a systematic tilt of the epilayer relative to the substrate. However, a small degree of ordering leads to nearly 100 of dislocation glide on planes opposite to the expected planes from the substrate miscut. This result is explained as a consequence of the asymmetry between {\{}111{\}} glide planes of CuPt-ordered material. Lowering the ordering parameter by changing bulk composition results in a change in glide plane distribution and is accomplished through the formation of new dislocations. Control of the glide plane distribution is therefore possible by controlling the ordering parameter on a vicinal substrate. Knowledge and control of this relaxation mechanism is important for the reduction of threading dislocations in lattice-mismatched devices. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

The light current-voltage curve and spectral response of the samples were measured. The sample grown at an As/Ga BEP ratio of 10 showed the highest energy conversion efficiency with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.529 V and a short circuit current density of 17.0 mA/cm2. This measured VOC is the highest ever reported value in GaNAsSb 1-eV photovoltaic cell, resulting in the lowest ever reported Eg/q-VOC of 0.50 eV. The increase in the As/Ga BEP ratio also resulted in an increase in the bandgap-voltage offset value (Eg/q-VOC) and a decrease in quantum efficiency up to As/Ga BEP ratio of 18.},

abstract = {GaInNAs sol ar cells grown by metal - organic, chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) are known to demonstrate dramatic changes in performance upon annealing. GaInNAs necessarily experiences some in situ annealing when integrated into a multijunction cell, as when the upper four junctions of a six - junction ( e.g ., AlGaInP/GaInP/AlGaInAs/GaInAs/ GaInNAs/Ge) cell are grown on top of the GaInNAs subcell. Therefore, understanding the changes that occur during these inadvertent, in situ anneals is necessary to design an MOCVD gro wth process for high - performance six - junction cells. These six - junction cells have the potential for {\textgreater} 50{\%} efficiency under the concentrated terrestrial spectrum and {\textgreater} 40 {\%} under the air mass zero ( AM0 ) spectrum. This paper shows how an in situ anneal at 650°C can cause movement of the junction in the GaInNAs, first improving and then ruining the performance of the cell. Similarly, in situ annealing depends on the annealing temperature, showing, for the conditions studied, optimal performance for an anneal at 675°C. Higher temperatures resulted in improved material quality, but the junction did not move, resulting in inferior performance compared with the samples annealed at lower temperatures. The performance of the best GaInNAs cells is summarized showin g background carrier concentrations as low as 2 X 10 15 cm -3 , depletion widths as wide as {\~{}} 0.6 $\mu$ m, and AM0 photocurrents for operation under GaAs approaching 12 mA/cm 2 .},

abstract = {In this work, we have investigated the effect of antimony (Sb) on the uniform incorporation of nitrogen atoms in GaInNAs alloy grown with different levels of Sb fluxes. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) are both improved for a narrow range of Sb flux between 1×10−8 and 5×10−8Torr, in which Sb plays the role of surfactant. On the other hand, higher level of Sb flux deteriorates the PL characteristics most likely due to Sb-related defects. Furthermore in temperature dependent PL measurements, drastic peak energy shifts were observed in all samples, which indicate a strong carrier localization. Although GaInNAs sample showed a large energy shift of 53meV, supply of Sb decreased the localization energies to 13–22meV. These results show that optimized amount of Sb, maintaining a high growth temperature of 520°C, enhances the homogeneity of potential energy in conduction band of GaInNAs alloy, since the carrier localization is led by inhomogeneous N incorporation.},

abstract = {Graphene has been intensively studied in photovoltaics focusing on emerging solar cells based on thin films, dye‐sensitized solar cells, quantum dots, nanowires, and so forth. However, the typical efficiency of these solar cells incorporating graphene is below 16{\%}. Therefore, the photovoltaic potential of graphene has not yet been shown. In this work, the use of graphene for concentration applications on III‐V multijunction solar cells, which indeed are the solar cells with the highest efficiency, is demonstrated. First, a wide optoelectronic characterization of graphene layers is carried out. Then, the graphene layer is incorporated onto triple‐junction solar cells, which decreases their series resistance by 35{\%} (relative), leading to an increase in fill factor of 4{\%} (absolute) at concentrations of 1000 suns. Simultaneously, the optical absorption of graphene produces a relative short‐circuit current density decrease in the range of 0{\%} to 1.8{\%}. As a result, an absolute efficiency improvement close to 1{\%} at concentrations of 1000 suns was achieved with respect to triple‐junction solar cells without graphene.

All the structures exhibited variety of deep energy levels with high concentrations. In addition to the most commonly described arsenic antisite defect, with activation energies 0.73-0.78 eV, possible traces of oxygen-arsenic vacancies with 0.52 eV and nitrogen interstitial complexes were evaluated. Most dominant electron trap at about 0.53 eV below the conduction band EC was observed at different measurement conditions. Based on various references, this electron trap can be associated with a split interstitial defect containing two nitrogen atoms on the same As lattice site. Calculated energies and possible origins of these results were confirmed by Arrhenius curve comparison.},

abstract = {We have grown (GaIn)(NAs) lattice-matched bulk as well as compressively strained multi-quantum-well structures by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) suitable for either solar cell or laser applications, respectively. By applying a specific novel TEM dark-field technique columnar strain fields, which are possibly caused by chain-like N ordering in the samples, have been detected. Valence force field calculations show that indeed these chains are energetically stable in Ga(NAs). This chain-like ordering can be dissolved in (GaIn)(NAs), however, upon appropriate annealing, as verified experimentally. On the other hand we find that device performance especially of lasers is limited by carbon impurities in the active (GaIn)(NAs) region of the lasers. The strong affinity of N–C results in an enhanced incorporation of C if the N content in the material is increased. The paper also shows the sources of C incorporation in (GaIn)(NAs) MOVPE growth and how its incorporation can possibly be avoided.},

The Poynting vector is used to derive the light energy flux in the case of a layer with coherent behavior. Multilayer structures with any distribution of layers with coherent or incoherent behavior can be treated, including the case of oblique incidence. Use of the light energy flux instead of the more commonly used light intensity permits the calculation of light absorption with a better accuracy and a much shorter computation time.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the concentrator solar cell reliability in a real application for a given location provided the results from accelerated life tests. We have applied this methodology for the evaluation of warranty times of commercial triple junction solar cells operating inside real concentrator modules in Golden (Colorado, USA), Madrid (Spain) and Tucson (Arizona, USA) for the period 2012–2015. Warranty times in Golden and Madrid, namely, 68 and 31 years, respectively, for the analysed period, indicate the robustness of commercial triple junction solar cells. Nevertheless, the warranty time of 15 years for Tucson suggests the need of improvement in the heat extraction of the solar cell within the concentrator module. Therefore, the influence of the location on the reliability of concentrator solar cells is huge, and it has no sense to supply general reliability values for a given concentrator product. The influence of these warranty times for the three locations on the levelised cost of electricity has been analysed. Cost of €c10–12/kWh can be achieved nowadays, while after 1 GWpcumulative installed power, a dramatic reduction to levels of €c2–3/kWh is achievable.

abstract = {In this paper, a new multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA)-based approach is proposed to optimize the metal grid design in order to improve the electrical performance and the conversion efficiency behavior of the solar cells under high intensities of illumination. The proposed approach is applied to investigate the effect of two different metal grid patterns (one with 2 busbars outside the active area (linear grid) and another one with a circular busbar surrounding the active area (circular grid)) on the electrical performance of high efficiency c-Si solar cells under concentrated light (up to 150 suns). The dimensional and electrical parameters of the solar cell have been ascertained, and analytical expressions of the power losses and conversion efficiency, including high illumination effects, have been presented. The presented analytical models are used to formulate different objective functions, which are the prerequisite of the multiobjective optimization. The optimized design can also be incorporated into photovoltaic circuit simulator to study the impact of our approach on the photovoltaic circuit design. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We provide qualitative insight into depletion-region collection in GaInNAs cells to (1) understand the effect of diffusion length L on the QE; and (2) describe the magnitude of L required to get adequate current from the cell. We use Wolf's equations for the QE including a drift field E, and model E as being equal to the junction built-in voltage distributed uniformly across the depletion region. This allows us to calculate the QE as a function of L and depletion width WD. We show that if L is sufficiently small, increasing WD can actually decrease the QE. To determine how long L needs to be in a practical GaInNAs junction, we calculate from the QE the short-circuit current density as a function of WD and L. This allows us to estimate that Lambipolar needs to be greater than roughly 1 {\&}mu;m in order to obtain enough photocurrent for the 4-junction application, giving guidance to the experimental effort to develop such cells.},

On the other hand, we point out some features of this alloy system and evaluate its potential for device applications. Probably, GaNAsSb can achieve emission at longer wavelengths than GaInNAs alloys grown to date. Its conduction- and valence-band offsets can be independently tuned by adjusting the N and Sb composition, respectively. Since this compound has a single group III element, its electronic structure should be less dependent on alloy configuration than GaInNAs.},

abstract = {Mechanically stacked III−V-on-Si (III−V//Si) tandem solar cells have demonstrated efficiencies beyond what can theoretically be achieved by single junction Si solar cells, but III−V costs are currently at least an order of magnitude higher than Si costs. Recent techno-economic analysis shows that costs could be substantially reduced by replacing traditional metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) with a lower-cost III−V deposition technique, such as hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). This study analyzes the performance of an HVPE-grown GaAs top cell incorporated into a 4-terminal (4T) GaAs//Si tandem cell that achieved an efficiency of 29{\%}, which is the highest solar cell efficiency fabricated without expensive deposition techniques such as MOVPE or MBE. We compare these results to an MOVPE-grown GaAs//Si tandem cell that has the same structure. Finally, we model optimizations to the HVPE-grown GaAs top cell and provide a near-term pathway to 31.4{\%} efficiency with a low-cost III−V deposition technique. T he record efficiency for single junction Si solar cells is 26.7{\%} 1 which is approaching the theoretical efficiency limit of 29.56{\%} for this technology. 2 In contrast, the record for a dual junction (2J) GaAs//Si tandem solar cell with subcells operated independently (i.e., 4-terminal or 4T) is 32.8{\%} 3 with numerical simulations predicting a 1 sun efficiency limit exceeding 40{\%}. 4 This gap between the record GaAs//Si tandem cell efficiency and the GaAs//Si theoretical efficiency limit offers promising opportunities for further improvements to these devices. The costs associated with these high-efficiency tandem solar cells, however, are still at least an order-of-magnitude higher than the costs associated with conventional Si solar cells. 5 A recent study provided techno-economic analysis for the costs of 4T 2J III−V//Si tandem solar cells, and a key cost driver was today's industry-dominant metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), which highlights the need for an alternative III−V deposition technique with increased tool throughput and lower precursor costs. 3 One candidate technique that meets these criteria is hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). It was estimated that this transition from MOVPE to HVPE, along with optimized substrate reuse, higher manufacturing yield, and a lower operating margin, could lead to an 80{\%} reduction in the {\$}/W costs between the near-to-midterm projected cost scenarios for GaAs//Si dual junction solar cells. 3 HVPE is a promising, cost-effective alternative to MOVPE because it enables higher throughput and avoids the need for intensive processing and purification to form the metalorganic reagents necessary for MOVPE. HVPE instead uses elemental group III material and offers improved reactant utilization. 6 Although progress has recently been made toward high-rate MOVPE growth, 7 traditional MOVPE typically exhibits thin-film growth rates up to 15 \mum/h for GaAs, 5 whereas HVPE has demonstrated GaAs growth rates up to 300 \mum/h. 8 A recent study investigated the performance of single junction GaAs solar cells fabricated from HVPE-grown materials and found negligible variation in the open circuit voltage (V oc) for a series of cells grown at rates varying from 55 to 110 \mum/h, indicating that the quality of the material does not deteriorate with increasing growth rate. 9 In an effort to evaluate whether these projected cost reductions could be achieved without compromising performance , this study reports on the performance of an HVPE-grown GaAs top cell incorporated into a GaAs//Si tandem device with an efficiency of 29{\%}. We also analyze the performance of a GaAs//Si tandem cell fabricated with an MOVPE-grown GaAs top cell that has the same structure as the HVPE-grown cell and compare the current-density−voltage (JV) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of these},

Compared to standard size production cells, the micro cells have reduced performance at 1-sun due to perimeter recombination, but the performance gap closes at higher concentrations. Micro cells integrated with lens arrays were tested on-sun with an efficiency of 34.7{\%}.

abstract = {The dilute nitrides like (GaIn)(NAs) or Ga(NAsSb) are attractive materials for the next generation of photovoltaic cells with four to six active junctions. Unfortunately, these compounds suffer from a low minority carrier diffusion length. This can be partially compensated by choosing suitable device structures with a reduced prerequisite on the necessary current density. (GaIn)(NAs) solar cells with a bandgap between 1.0 and 1.2eV have been grown by metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy on single- and 8×4-in multiwafer reactors. Short-circuit current densities up to 10.9mA/cm2 (AM0) have been achieved for a (GaIn)(NAs) cell filtered with GaAs. This excellent value is sufficient for the application in five- or six-junction photovoltaic cells. Challenges are resulting from the transfer of growth conditions to a production size multi-wafer MOVPE reactor, which are discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {In this study, we demonstrated the fabrication and characterization of p-GaAs/i-InGaAsN/n-GaAs double hetero-junction solar cells (DHJSCs). The intrinsic InGaAsN absorption layer which is lattice-matched with GaAs substrates was grown by the metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system. The metal-organic sources used in the MOVPE growth induced unintentionally-doped carbon adatoms, and this in turn caused some carbon-related defects. This carbon pollution subsequently deteriorated the optical and electrical characteristics of the dilute nitride material. With ex-situ post-annealing being carried out in the furnace, it could not only modify the crystallinity of the InGaAsN material, but the deterioration in the performance of the dilute nitride solar cell due to the nitrogen incorporation could also be mitigated. After conducting the thermal annealing at 550 °C for 1 h in nitrogen ambience, the conversion efficiency of the DHJSCs was increased from 0.61{\%} to 4.46{\%} under Air Mass 1.5 Global (1000 W/m 2, AM1.5 G) irradiance. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum further revealed that the efficiency of DHJSCs had been enhanced significantly owing to the crystalline improvement of the intrinsic InGaAsN absorption layer after the ex-situ post-thermal annealing was implemented. This improvement also led to a significant increase in the short-circuit current. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement result also showed that the ex-situ thermal annealing contributed to the improvement of crystal quality and the reduction of carbon related defects and clusters in the as-grown InGaAsN absorption layer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A direct correlation between PL intensity and quantum efficiency in the (GaIn)(NAs) material system is observed. Thermal annealing in this material can be used to initiate the site change of the Nitrogen atom from a Ga-rich environment upon growth to an In-rich one after annealing.

abstract = {III-IV-V heterovalent alloys have the potential to satisfy the need for infrared bandgap materials that also have lattice constants near GaAs. In this work, significant room temperature photoluminescence is reported for the first time in high quality III-IV-V alloys grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Pronounced phase separation, a characteristic suspected to quench luminescence in the alloys in the past, was successfully inhibited by a modified growth process. Small scale composition fluctuations were observed in the alloys; higher growth temperatures resulted in fluctuations with a striated morphology, while lower growth temperatures resulted in fluctuations with a speckled morphology. The composition fluctuations cause bandgap narrowing in the alloys - measurements of various compositions of (GaAs)1-x(Ge2)x alloys reveal a maximum energy transition of 0.8 eV under 20{\%} Ge composition rather than a continuously increasing transition with the decreasing Ge composition. Additionally, luminescence intensity decreased with the decreasing Ge composition. The alloys appear to act as a Ge-like solid penetrating a GaAs lattice, resulting in optical properties similar to those of Ge but with a direct-bandgap nature; a decrease in the Ge composition corresponds to a reduction in the light-emitting Ge-like material within the lattice. An energy transition larger than 0.8 eV was obtained through the addition of silicon to the (GaAs)1-x(Ge2)x alloy. The results indicate significant promise for III-IV-V alloys as potential materials for small bandgap optical devices with previously unachievable lattice constants.},

A mathematical approach is presented which enables a fast way of spectral mismatch correction for MJ cells, thereby significantly reducing the time required for calibration. Moreover, a systematic investigation of the I-V parameters of a MJ solar cell with variation of the incident spectrum is possible, herein called 'spectrometric characterization'. This analysis method visualizes the effects of current limitation and shifting of the operating voltage, and yields precise information about the current-matching of the subcells. MJ cells can hereby be compared without the need to match the current of the structures to a reference spectrum in advance. Further applications of the spectrometric characterization are suggested, such as for the determination of the radiation response of the subcells of MJ space solar cells or for the prediction of the annual power output of terrestrial MJ concentrator cells.},

abstract = {This paper presents and discusses the first deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) data obtained from measurements carried out on both Schottky barriers and homojunction devices of GaInNAs. The effect of N and In doping on the electrical properties of the GaNInAs devices, which results in structural defects and interface states, has been investigated. Moreover, the location and densities of deep levels related to the presence of N, In, and N+In are identified and correlated with the device performance. The data confirmed that the presence of N alone creates a high density of shallow hole traps related to the N atom and structural defects in the device. Doping by In, if present alone, also creates low-density deep traps (related to the In atom and structural defects) and extremely deep interface states. On the other hand, the co-presence of In and N eliminates both the interface states and levels related to structural defects. However, the device still has a high density of the shallow and deep traps that are responsible for the photocurrent loss in the GaNInAs device, together with the possible short diffusion length.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. Germanium solar cells are used as bottom subcells in many multijunction solar cell designs. The question remains whether the thermal load originated by the growth of the upper layers of the multijunction solar cell structure affects the Ge subcell performance. Here, we report and analyze the performance degradation of the Ge subcell due to such thermal load in lattice-matched GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple-junction solar cells. Specifically, we have detected a quantum efficiency loss in the wavelength region corresponding to the emitter layer (which accounts for up to 20{\%} loss in equivalent J SC ) and up to 55 mV loss in V OC of the Ge subcell as compared with analogous devices grown as single-junction Ge solar cells on the same type of substrates. We prove experimentally that there is no direct correlation between the loss in V OC and the doping level of the base. Our simulations show that both the J SC and V OC losses are consistent with a degradation of the minority carrier properties at the emitter, in particular at the initial nanometers of the emitter next to the emitter/window heterointerface. In addition, we also rule out the gradual emitter profile shape as the origin of the degradation observed. Our findings underscore the potential to obtain higher efficiencies in Ge-based multijunction solar cells if strategies to mitigate the impact of the thermal load are taken into consideration.},

abstract = {We report a study comparing the device performance and the deep-level transient spectroscopy spectra of Ga1-yInyNxAs1-x diodes. It is found that a transient capacitance signal, which corresponds to a trap 0.18 to 0.25 eV below the conduction-band edge, is observed near 140 K in the nitrogen-containing samples. The existence of this transient correlates with higher dark current [lower open-circuit voltage (Voc)] and the size of the transient increases with x for x≤0.6{\%}. The abrupt decrease of the Voc with the addition of nitrogen is explained by the hypothesis that a close approach of the electron quasi-Fermi level to the conduction-band edge is arrested by the electron trap. The N-induced trap level reduces Voc as if it were a new conduction-band edge.},

The temperature range for the realization of high structural layer quality is established from about 500 to 525°C. MQWH with extremely narrow XRD linewidths of 21″ (FWHM) are achieved. The N-incorporation behaviour as a function of TBAs partial pressure, As/N-partial pressure ratio and of the growth rate is clarified in detail. The N-incorporation is reduced with increasing In-content in the (GaIn)(NAs) layer. Excellent surface morphologies indicatetd by smooth terraces with monolayer height steps are achieved for N-concentrations up to 4.5{\%}. Above this critical value a deterioriation in structural quality is observed. The band gap reduction with increasing N-incorporation is established from PL studies at room temperature. The optical characteristics as a function of N-concentration and growth conditions are discussed briefly. PL emission of as-grown samples with wavelengths up to 1.55$\mu$m at room temperature is achieved.},

abstract = {III–V semiconductors containing small amounts of Nitrogen (“dilute nitrides”) are very promising material systems for optoelectronic applications. There are many studies about growth characterization of Ga(NAs) in metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), but very little is known about the nitridation process on the GaAs (0 0 1) surface and the influence of the surface reconstruction on the Nitrogen (N) incorporation. Therefore, we investigated GaAs (0 0 1) surfaces under different tertiarybutylarsine (TBAs) and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMHy) ambient conditions in MOVPE. For in situ surface characterization reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) was used. Under sufficient TBAs stabilization the surface forms an As rich c(4 × 4)$\beta$ surface reconstruction. This changes towards a more Ga rich (2 × 6)/(6 × 6)-like reconstruction if additional N is supplied. Therefore, UDMHy seems to enhance the As desorption from the surface or the surface reconstruction changes due to incorporated N. This conversion occurs rapidly within 5 s when UDMHy is supplied and was observed in a temperature range from 450 °C to 600 °C. The measured RAS spectra are then compared to the RAS spectra obtained during Ga(NAs) growth. These also exhibit a (2 × 6)/(6 × 6)-like surface reconstruction which seems to be necessary to incorporate a sufficient amount of N into the GaAs crystal.},

When using standard conditions, our calculated efficiency limits show good agreement with current photovoltaic efficiency records, but solar cells designed for record efficiency under the current standard spectra are not optimal for maximizing the yearly energy yield. Our results show that more than 1 MWh m−2 year−1 can realistically be obtained from advanced multijunction systems making use of the direct, diffuse, and back-side albedo components of the irradiance.},

Atomic force microscopy images reveal that, at sufficiently high bismuth flux, step flow growth occurs in GaN0.004As0.996 even at substrate temperatures as low as 460°C. This results in an order of magnitude decrease in the surface roughness. A similar smoothing effect is obtained when growing GaAs and AlGaAs thin films with bismuth. Furthermore, Bi is found to enhance the incorporation of nitrogen into GaNAs. The peak photoluminescence intensity from an In0.26Ga0.74N0.011As0.989 QW is increased by more than a factor of two with the surfactant.

The question arises under which conditions a tandem solar cell becomes economically preferable to both of the single-junction sub-cells it comprises. We present an analysis based on cost and efficiency relations to answer this question for a double-junction tandem solar cell. We find that combining two ideally band-gap-matched single-junction solar cell technologies into a tandem should be a “marriage of equals”: the sub cells should be produced at similar {\$} per W costs, both sub cells should have similar efficiencies when operated independently, and the costs to turn both cells into a system should be similar. We discuss examples of different hypothetical and actual tandem solar cell technologies and show the intricacies of imbalances in the mentioned factors. We find that tandem-solar-cell-based PV power stations for existing solar-cell technologies offer the potential to reduce the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), provided suitable top cells are developed.},

abstract = {The effects of H on the interaction between Ga vacancies VGa and N in GaAs1-xNx dilute alloys are studied through first-principles total-energy calculations. We find that N binds to Ga vacancies and that in the presence of H this binding is enhanced. The formation energy of VGa bonded to N and H (resulting in a N-H-V-Ga complex) can be more than 2 eV lower than that of the isolated Ga vacancy VGa in GaAs. Our finding that the concentration of VGa increases with N and even more in the presence of H allows us to interpret several recent experiments. [References: 26]},

abstract = {Antimony has been used as a surfactant to improve the quality of GaInNAsGaAs quantum wells for long-wavelength optoelectronics. We demonstrate the importance of antimony as a reactive surfactant and the proper usage of it with dilute nitrides in order to tailor the properties of solar cell and laser devices. The effects of the addition of antimony to low indium concentration (∼8{\%}) and low strain GaInNAs material (for 1.0 eV solar cell applications) were investigated. It was assumed previously that adding antimony helped all GaInNAs alloys, but the validity of this was not previously tested. The addition of antimony to high indium concentration (∼32{\%}) and high strain GaInNAs samples led to a dramatic improvement in optical quality and a widening of the growth window, while it led to a degradation in the low indium (low strain) composition samples. The addition of indium under constant antimony flux also improved the optical quality of the GaInNAs material. Variations in the indium and antimony compositions revealed a competition in atomic incorporation into the GaInNAsSb alloy. This interaction will be discussed. Increasing indium and/or strain confirmed the reactive surfactant properties of antimony on GaInNAsSb alloys. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {To investigate perimeter recombination current in heteroface GaAs solar cells, two models were proposed; the first concerned the analysis of recombination at the surface that intersects the space-charge layer and the second dealt with recombination at the quasi-neutral region. Recombination at the depleted layer surface has a 2kT character and was treated in a similar way to that of the bulk, using the model of Sah, Noyce and Shockley. The electric field at the surface due to Fermi level pinning is different from that of the bulk. We suggested a simple model to obtain an analytical form of the perimeter current at the space-charge region surface that yielded values of the product of the characteristic length by the surface recombination velocity (LsS0) that agreed well with experimental values. The recombination current outside the space-region is of two dimensional nature and has a kT behaviour, the model adopted consisted mainly of solving numerically the bidimensional continuity equation. An effective recombination velocity was introduced to account for bend bending caused by the charged surface states. As the ratio of perimeter to area (P/A) is increased the perimeter current acquired significant proportions, thus the expected 2kT current due to bulk deep levels existing in the depletion layer is two to three orders of magnitude too small to account for.},

In an attempt to find the impact of coupling effects on different shunt resistance devices, EQE measurements have been carried out at high intensity light bias conditions. These measurements showed that in those conditions, the coupling current in high quality materials is considerably higher compared to low quality ones and lead to a higher reduction of the EQE signal. The difference in EQE is, nevertheless, small and it is apparent in all the response region of the material.},

abstract = {We investigated the relation between N-H complexes and the electrical properties of GaAsN, which is a potential material for fabricating super-high-efficiency multi-junction tandem solar cells. In order to separate the effect of other residual carrier such as carbon in a GaAsN film on the electrical properties, hydrogen (H) ions were implanted into GaAsN grown by chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) and then rapid thermal annealing from 250 to 650 ??C was carried out. Two N-H complexes related to local vibrational modes (LVMs) in GaAsN were observed at 3098 and 3125 cm-1. With an increasing annealing temperature, the integrated peak intensity of the 3098 cm-1 peak (I3098) decreased, while that of the 3125 cm-1 peak (I3125) increased. This indicates that N-H complexes related to the 3125 cm-1 peak are thermally more stable than those related to the other peak. The hole concentrations and mobilities exhibited an increasing trend until an annealing temperature of 550 ??C was reached. Their increases are attributed to the removal of donor-type defects. It is suggested that the N-H complexes related to the 3098 cm-1 peak are electrically active, while those giving the 3125 cm-1 peak are inactive. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Comparing lock-in thermography (LIT) images with luminescence images of various shunted cells, measured under different conditions, the ability of luminescence techniques for shunt detection is investigated. Luminescence imaging allows identifying ohmic shunts only if they reach a certain strength. The detection limit for PL measurements of linear shunts was estimated to be in the order of 15mA at 0?5V bias for a point-like shunt in multicrystalline (mc) cells.

abstract = {In this paper we review our recent results from optical and magneto-optical studies which have allowed identification of the dominant radiative and some non-radiative (NR) recombination processes in Ga(In)NAs and GaNP alloys and related quantum structures. The dominant mechanism for photoluminescence (PL) in Ga(In)NAs is determined as recombination of excitons trapped by potential fluctuations of the band edge, induced by compositional disorder and strain non-uniformity of the alloy. The alloy fluctuations are shown to be largely related to non-optimized growth conditions and can be suppressed by increasing growth temperature or using post-growth thermal annealing. On the other hand, the PL emissions in GaNP alloys are concluded to arise from deep states likely related to N clusters whereas the band-to-band recombination is predominantly NR. With increasing N composition the defect states are shown to become resonant with the conduction band of the alloy and thus optically inactive, leading to an apparent red shift of the PL maximum position. Experimental evidence for a band crossover from an indirect to a direct band gap in GaNP at very low N compositions ({\~{}}0.5{\%}) is provided from the transient studies of the PL transitions. The first available experimental information on the chemical identity and formation mechanism of NR defects in Ga(In)NAs is also presented.},

abstract = {The energy gap of dilute nitride GaAsSbN has been studied. We found that the energy gap reduction induced by nitrogen incorporation is nearly independent of the Sb composition of the alloy, indicating that the conduction band and the valence band can be independently manipulated by incorporating N and Sb, respectively. A "double" band anticrossing (BAC) model, which is a combination of a BAC model for GaAsN and a valence BAC model for GaAsSb with the localized levels and hybridization parameters reported in literatures, has been proposed to fit the energy gap of annealed GaAsSbN samples. The as-grown samples, however, are with lower energy gaps, most likely resulting from the existence of substitutional N pairing and clustering in the alloys. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {The meteoric rise of perovskite single-junction solar cells has been accompanied by similar stunning developments in perovskite tandem solar cells. Debuting with efficiencies less than 14{\%} in 2014, silicon–perovskite solar cells are now above 25{\%} and will soon surpass record silicon single-junction efficiencies. Unconstrained by the Shockley–Quiesser single-junction limit, perovskite tandems suggest a real possibility of true third-generation thin-film photovoltaics; monolithic all-perovskite tandems have reached 18{\%} efficiency and will likely pass perovskite single-junction efficiencies within the next 5 years. Inorganic–organic metal–halide perovskites are ideal candidates for inclusion in tandem solar cells due to their high radiative recombination efficiencies, excellent absorption, long-range charge-transport, and broad ability to tune the bandgap. In this progress report, the development of perovskite tandem cells is reviewed, with presentation of their key motivations and challenges. In detail, it presents an overview of recombination layer materials, bandgap-tuneability, transparent contact architectures, and perovskite compounds for use in tandems. Theoretical estimates of efficiency for future tandem and triple-junction perovskite cells are presented, outlining roadmaps for future focused research.},

abstract = {Umicore has been the leading Germanium substrate manufacturer over the last 20 years. We are only able to maintain that position by constantly improving the quality of our product. In this work, Umicore wants to present how it will continue this tradition by adding even more value to its product. In the beginning of 2014 we proposed to our customers to help them in achieving their yield improvement goals. Two main concerns were expressed: the breakage rate in their production line and non-uniform epi-growth. After two years of development, Umicore has bundled these two improvements into a new product. The ExpoGer™ wafer combines a better mechanical yield with a uniform, epi-ready surface enabling a narrower distribution of the electrical performance. The breakage rate of the customers is related to the wafers that suffer from early failure. The percentage of early failures is related to its thickness. With the trend towards even thinner substrates, it is important to add features that reduce the percentage of early failures. Two features are crucial: the shape of the substrate edge and the stress relief etch, which influences the wafer strength. Just as for the strength, two distinctive aspects define the surface quality. On the one hand, there are the number and size of surface defects, which have an important influence on the metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) growth performed at Umicore's customers. On the other hand, drying marks, which are invisible to the naked eye, may lead to a local, non-uniform growth and they can be a precursor to time dependent haze issues. Umicore is able to demonstrate the impact of the ExpoGer™ processes on the strength and surface quality of its wafers and thus on the production yield of its customers.},

We also measured photoreflectance spectroscopy in order to determine the energy of the band-edge transition. The Stokes shift of the PL-peak energy under a weak excitation condition decreases from 20 meV in no TMSb flow to 15 meV in the TMSb flow of 5×10-7 mol/min. The PL-decay time in the low-energy PL tail related to localized states is obviously shortened by the TMSb flow. The decay profiles detected at various energies can be explained by a stretched exponential form peculiar to disordered systems. The overall results of the PL characterization demonstrate that the carrier localization is reduced by the TMSb flow to the interface. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to quantify the electron diffusion length in p-type GaInAsN and to understand the performance of GaInAsN cells. The usual modeling is complicated because the electron diffusion length is quite short (often {\textless}0.1 $\mu$m) and is usually less than the hole diffusion length. The properties (e.g. absorption and transport) of GaInAsN are both variable and poorly studied, and, because the band gap of GaInAsN is less than the band gap of the substrate, light that is transmitted through the GaInAsN layer may be reflected from the back metallization and make a second pass through the GaInAsN. Layers that are expected to be p-type can sometimes change to n-type, changing the location of the junction and complicating the modeling, but improving the performance of the cell.

abstract = {We have investigated the role of the nitrogen content, the growth parameters, and the annealing processes involved in molecular beam epitaxy of GaInNAs solar cells lattice-matched to GaAs. The nitrogen composition was varied between 1{\%} and 5{\%}. The influence of the growth temperature was assessed by performing photoluminescence, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, reflection high-energy electron diffraction, quantum efficiency and light-biased current-voltage measurements. The growth temperature ensuring the best cell parameters was found to be 440 degrees C. At this temperature we were able to incorporate up to 4{\%} of nitrogen and achieve a good material quality. Further increase of the N composition to 5{\%} led to phase separation. For the lattice matched samples grown within the optimal temperature range, we have identified a clear (1 x 3) surface reconstruction. Using the optimized growth we have demonstrated a GaInNAs p-i-n solar cell structure containing 4{\%} nitrogen, that exhibited a short-circuit current density as high as 33.8 mA/cm(2) in respect to effective area illuminated.

@article{Barrigon2012,
abstract = {The electrical and optical coupling between subcells in a multijunction solar cell affects its external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement. In this study, we show how a low breakdown voltage of a component subcell impacts the EQE deter- mination of a multijunction solar cell and demands the use of a finely adjusted external voltage bias. The optimum voltage bias for the EQE measurement of a Ge subcell in two different GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells is determined both by sweeping the external voltage bias and by tracing the I–V curve under the same light bias conditions applied dur- ing the EQE measurement. It is shown that the I–V curve gives rapid and valuable information about the adequate light and voltage bias needed, and also helps to detect problems associated with non-ideal I–V curves that might affect the EQE measurement. The results also show that, if a non-optimum voltage bias is applied, a measurement artifact can result. Only when the problems associated with a non-ideal I–V curve and/or a low breakdown voltage have been discarded, the mea- surement artifacts, if any, can be attributed to other effects such as luminescent coupling between subcells.

abstract = {We present here the preliminary growth and characterization results on the integration of GaAs/GaNAsSb/GaAs III-V layer structure on Ge/graded-SiGe/Si substrate or simply silicon virtual substrate (SVS). It was found in cross-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study that a sub-optimal Ge surface annealing (below 600 ??C) was detrimental to the subsequent growth of III-V layer, and surface pitting was observed on the GaAs surface as a result. This surface pit was found to originate from the heterovalent interface between the Ge substrate surface and the GaAs epitaxy. By properly treating the Ge surface with in-situ annealing at 640 ??C and low temperature GaAs seeding before epitaxy growth, the above III-V layer structure can be successfully grown with smooth surface morphology. The atomic force microcopy (AFM) results correlated well with the RHEED observation and provided further insight into the quality of three GaAs/GaNAsSb/GaAs samples. The root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of the GaAs/GaNAsSb/GaAs layer structures with GaAs grown at 650, 610, and 580 ??C were 25.9, 6.2, and 1.7 nm, respectively. In addition, upon annealing at ???750 ??C for 1 min in N2 ambient, one of the GaAs/GaNAsSb/GaAs sample showed a 5 K photoluminescence (PL) spectrum that was dominated by a peak with emission energy at 980 nm or equivalent to 1.27 eV. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two electron traps, E1 and E2 at an energy level 0.12 and 0.41 eV below the conduction band (EC), respectively, were found in undoped GaInNAs. Bias-voltage dependent admittance confirmed that E1 is an interface-type defect being spatially localized at the GaInNAs/GaAs interface, while E2 is a bulk-type defect located around mid-gap of GaInNAs layer.

abstract = {Technological deployment of organic photovoltaic modules requires improvements in device light-conversion efficiency and stability while keeping material costs low. Here we demonstrate highly efficient and stable solar cells using a ternary approach, wherein two non-fullerene acceptors are combined with both a scalable and affordable donor polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a high-efficiency, low-bandgap polymer in a single-layer bulk-heterojunction device. The addition of a strongly absorbing small molecule acceptor into a P3HT-based non-fullerene blend increases the device efficiency up to 7.7 ± 0.1{\%} without any solvent additives. The improvement is assigned to changes in microstructure that reduce charge recombination and increase the photovoltage, and to improved light harvesting across the visible region. The stability of P3HT-based devices in ambient conditions is also significantly improved relative to polymer:fullerene devices. Combined with a low-bandgap donor polymer (PBDTTT-EFT, also known as PCE10), the two mixed acceptors also lead to solar cells with 11.0 ± 0.4{\%} efficiency and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.03 ± 0.01 V.},

abstract = {The self-absorption of radiated photons increases the minority carrier concentration in semiconductor optoelectronic devices such as solar cells. This so-called photon recycling leads to an increase in the external luminescent efficiency, the fraction of internally radiated photons that are able to escape through the front surface. An increased external luminescent efficiency in turn correlates with an increased open-circuit voltage and ultimately conversion efficiency. We develop a detailed ray-optical model that calculates Voc for real, non-idealized solar cells, accounting for isotropic luminescence, parasitic losses, multiple photon reflections within the cell and wavelength-dependent indices of refraction for the layers in the cell. We have fabricated high quality GaAs solar cells, systematically varying the optical properties including the back reflectance, and have demonstrated Voc = 1.101 ± 0.002 V and conversion efficiencies of (27.8 ± 0.8){\%} under the global solar spectrum. The trends shown by the model are in good agreement with the data.},

abstract = {GaNAs(Sb) layers were grown by solid-source molecular-beam epitaxy utilizing a radio frequency (rf) nitrogen plasma source. The samples contained less nitrogen and antimony (0.5{\%}-0.8{\%} N and {\textless}= 2{\%} Sb) than in previous studies and were examined for their optical and electronic properties and any interactions between the elements. Secondary-ion-mass spectrometry, high-resolution x-ray diffraction, electroreflectance (ER) spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were used to study those properties. We found that the addition of small amounts of antimony enhanced nitrogen incorporation into GaAs, similar to other studies that used 5-15x the mole fraction of antimony. The nitrogen concentration increased with increasing antimony flux. PL measurements indicated an improvement in optical quality with increasing nitrogen and antimony concentrations-contrary to the belief that adding more nitrogen necessarily degrades material quality. We collected and simulated ER spectra to examine the general band properties of the layers. Isoelectronic codoping can explain the improved quality when antimony is added to GaNAs. The improvement in GaNAs with small amounts of antimony holds great promise for improving strain-compensated GaInNAs(Sb)/GaNAs devices. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {Absorbed sunlight in a solar cell produces electrons and holes.However, at the open-circuit condition, the carriers have no place to go. They build up in density, and ideally, they emit external luminescence that exactly balances the incoming sunlight. Any additional nonradiative recombination impairs the carrier density buildup, limiting the open-circuit voltage. At open circuit, efficient external luminescence is an indicator of low internal optical losses. Thus, efficient external luminescence is, counterintuitively, a necessity for approaching the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) efficiency limit. A great solar cell also needs to be a great light-emitting diode. Owing to the narrow escape cone for light, efficient external emission requires repeated attempts and demands an internal luminescence efficiency{\textgreater} {\textgreater}90{\%}.},

abstract = {The influence of non-radiative recombination on the photoluminescence$\backslash$ndecay time (tau(PL)) has been studied for GaInNAs/GaAs quantum wells$\backslash$nwith Ga- and In-rich environments of N atoms. At low temperatures, this$\backslash$ninfluence is suppressed, due to the carrier localization phenomenon,$\backslash$nwhich leads to a spectral dispersion of tau(PL). For investigated$\backslash$nsamples, this dispersion has been found to be in the range of similar to$\backslash$n0.2-2.0 ns. With the temperature increase, the free exciton emission$\backslash$nstarts to dominate instead of the localized exciton emission and the$\backslash$ndispersion of tau(PL) disappears. The dynamic of free exciton$\backslash$nrecombination is strongly influenced by the non-radiative recombination,$\backslash$nwhich varies between samples, due to different concentration of$\backslash$nnon-radiative centers. The study of influence of non-radiative$\backslash$nrecombination on tau(PL) has been performed at 180 K, since this$\backslash$ntemperature is high enough to eliminate the localized emission and$\backslash$nactivate non-radiative recombination and low enough to observe excitonic$\backslash$nemission without strong contribution of free carrier recombination when$\backslash$nthe sample is excited with low power. It was observed that, for as-grown$\backslash$nsamples, the tau(PL) increases from 0.14 to 0.25 ns with the change in$\backslash$nAs/III beam equivalent pressure ratio from 3.8 to 12.1 (in this case, it$\backslash$ncorresponds to the change in nitrogen nearest-neighbor environment from$\backslash$nGa- to In-rich), whereas, after annealing (i.e., also the change from$\backslash$nGa-rich to In-rich environment of N atoms), this time increases 2-4$\backslash$ntimes, depending on the As/III ratio. It has been concluded that the$\backslash$ntau(PL) is influenced by point defects rather than the nitrogen$\backslash$nnearest-neighbor environment, but their concentration is correlated with$\backslash$nthe type of nitrogen environment.

abstract = {First-principles calculations show that the hydrogen configurations in GaAsN depend on how hydrogen is introduced into the sample. Since proton and neutral H have different ground states, the proton injected into the sample by H-irradiation follows a unique energy pathway to form a charged dihydride, instead of the charge-neutral H2* monohydride. The subsequent charge neutralization causes the spontaneous canting of the dihydrides. The resulting canted N-2H structure explains the recent puzzling IR observation, the recoveries of the GaAs band gap and lattice parameter, and the dihydride symmetry determined by the XANES experiment. It may also have broad implications for ion implantation studies in other solids. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

After a summary of the physical basis of lock-in thermography and its practical realization, four types of quantitative measurements are described: local I–V characteristics measured thermally up to a constant factor (LIVT); the quanti- tative measurement of the current through a local shunt; the evaluation of the influ- ence of shunts on the efficiency of a cell as a function of the illumination intensity; and the mapping of the ideality factor n and the saturation current density J0 over the whole cell. The investigation of a typical multicrystalline solar cell shows that the shunts are predominantly responsible for deterioration of the low-light-level perfor- mance of the cell, and that variations of the injection current density related to crystal defects are predominantly determined by variation of J0 rather than of n.},

abstract = {Dilute nitrogen (N) containing III/V semiconductors are promising candidates for solar cell and laser applications. The N incorporation efficiency of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UMDHy) in metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), however, happens to be only in the one percentage range and below. This leads to an extremely high offer of UDMHy in the MOVPE reactor and, therefore, a drastic change in the growth conditions. Furthermore, the device efficiency of dilute nitride materials is currently hampered by carbon (C) incorporation, which is believed to be incorporated either jointly with the N from the dimethylamine radical of the UMDHy or from short hydrocarbon radicals originating from the decomposition of the other metal organics. Therefore, this work presents a novel N precursor N,N'-Bis(dimethylamino)acetamidinato-galliumdihydride [Ga(bdma)H2], which provides not only N but also gallium (Ga) during MOVPE. The direct N–Ga bond in this molecule might facilitate the N incorporation and hence increase the efficiency. For a systematic N incorporation study Ga(NAs)/GaAs heterostructures were grown by MOVPE. The N content was determined via high resolution X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) studies. Good structural quality and as grown room temperature PL were obtained. It will be also shown that the N incorporation efficiency in GaAs using [Ga(bdma)H2] is significantly higher than for growths using UDMHy under comparable conditions, making this class of molecules promising candidates for the growth of dilute nitride materials.},

abstract = {Dilute nitride GaInNAs alloys grown on GaAs have become perspective materials for so called low-cost GaAs-based devices working within the optical wavelength range up to 1.6$\mu$m. The multilayer structures of GaInNAs/GaAs multi-quantum well (MQW) samples usually are analyzed by using high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements. However, demands for precise structural characterization of the GaInNAs containing heterostructures requires taking into consideration all inhomogeneities of such structures. This paper describes some of the material challenges and progress in structural characterization of GaInNAs layers. A new algorithm for structural characterization of dilute nitrides which bounds contactless electro-reflectance (CER) or photo-reflectance (PR) measurements and HRXRD analysis results together with GaInNAs quantum well band diagram calculation is presented. The triple quantum well (3QW) GaInNAs/GaAs structures grown by atmospheric-pressure metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (AP-MOVPE) were investigated according to the proposed algorithm. Thanks to presented algorithm, more precise structural data including the nonuniformity in the growth direction of GaInNAs/GaAs QWs were achieved. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is mentioned as a nondestructive method for characterization of multicomponent inhomogeneous semiconductor structures with quantum wells.},

abstract = {As promising candidates for solar cell and photodetection applications in the range 1.0-1.16 eV, the growth of dilute nitride GaAsSbN alloys lattice matched to GaAs is studied. With this aim, we have taken advantage of the temperature gradient in the molecular beam epitaxy reactor to analyse the impact of temperature on the incorporation of Sb and N species according to the wafer radial composition gradients. The results from the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopies (EDS) show an opposite rate of incorporation between N and Sb as we move away from the centre of the wafer. A competitive behaviour between Sb and N in order to occupy the group-V position is observed that depends on the growth rate and the substrate temperature. The optical properties obtained by photoluminescence are discussed in the frame of the double-band anticrossing model. The growth conditions define two sets of different parameters for the energy level and the coupling interaction potential of N, which must be taken into account in the search for the optimum compositions 1-1.15-eV photonic applications.},

abstract = {The fast growth of PV installed capacity in Spain has led to an increase in the demand for analysis of installed PV modules. One of the topics that manufacturers, promoters, and owners of the plants are more interested in is the possible degradation of PV modules. This paper presents some findings of PV plant evaluations carried out during last years. This evaluation usually consists of visual inspections, I-V curve field measurements (the whole plant or selected areas), thermal evaluations by IR imaging and, in some cases, measurements of the I-V characteristics and thermal behaviours of selected modules in the plant, chosen by the laboratory. Electroluminescence technique is also used as a method for detecting defects in PV modules. It must be noted that new defects that arise when the module is in operation may appear in modules initially defect-free (called hidden manufacturing defects). Some of these hidden defects that only appear in normal operation are rarely detected in reliability tests (IEC61215 or IEC61646) due to the different operational conditions of the module in the standard tests and in the field (serial-parallel connection of many PV modules, power inverter influence, overvoltage on wires, etc.). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an improved 3D distributed model that considers real operation regimes in a tunnel junction. This advanced method is able to accurately simulate the high concentrations at which the current in the solar cell surpasses the peak current of the tunnel junction. Simulations of dual-junction solar cells were carried out with different light profiles and including chromatic aberration to show the capabilities of the model. Such simulations show that, under some circumstances, the solar cell short circuit current may be slightly higher than the tunnel junction peak current without showing the characteristic dip in the J-V curve. This behavior is caused by the lateral current spreading towards the dark regions, which occurs through the anode region of the tunnel junction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

These films, nominally lattice-matched to a GaAs substrate, were deposited at relatively higher growth temperature (600 °C) than typically used for MOVPE-grown dilute-nitride materials ({\~{}}500-530 °C), in order to reduce the background carbon impurity concentration. Even at these higher growth temperatures, sufficient N incorporation is achieved for targeting Eg{\~{}}1 eV InGaAsN and GaAsN with low background carrier concentration (1-2×1017 cm-3). The presence of Sb is found to significantly inhibit N incorporation, making it challenging to achieve films of GaAsSbN grown at 600 °C with a sufficient N concentration to achieve a 1 eV band gap energy. For GaAsN and InGaAsN on (311)B GaAs substrates, increased N incorporation with lower background carbon concentration is observed, relative to films on (100) GaAs. By contrast, GaAsSbN on (311)B GaAs substrate exhibit lower-N incorporation relative to films on (100) GaAs, presumably due to surface site competition between Sb and N. The background hole carrier concentrations of thermally annealed InGaAsN and GaAsSbN on (311)B are about a factor of two lower than those on (100) GaAs substrate.},

abstract = {The four-junction GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAs/Ge solar cell structure holds the promise of efficiencies exceeding those of the GaInP/GaAs/Ge three-junction cell, which at present is the benchmark for high-efficiency multijunction cell performance. The performance of GaInNAs junctions demonstrated to date has been insufficient for the realization of these projected efficiency gains, owing to poor minority-carrier properties in the GaInNAs. However, incremental improvements in the GaInNAs junctions have brought this breakeven point within sight. In this paper, we use a semiempirical approach to estimate the efficiency of the GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAs/Ge four-junction solar cell structure as a function of the performance parameters of the GaInNAs third junction. The results provide guidance on the extent to which the current and voltage of present-day GaInNAs junctions will need to be improved in order for the resulting four-junction cell to realize its potential for efficiencies higher than that of GaInP/GaAs/Ge benchmark.

abstract = {One of the most frequently used methods for characterizing thin films is UV–Vis absorption. The near-edge region can be fitted to a simple expression in which the intercept gives the band-gap and the fitting exponent identifies the electronic transition as direct or indirect (see Tauc et al., Phys. Status Solidi 15, 627 (1966); these are often called “Tauc” plots). While the technique is powerful and simple, the accuracy of the fitted band-gap result is seldom stated or known. We tackle this question by refitting a large number of Tauc plots from the literature and look for trends. Nominally pure zinc oxide (ZnO) was chosen as a material with limited intrinsic deviation from stoichiometry and which has been widely studied. Our examination of the band gap values and their distribution leads to a discussion of some experimental factors that can bias the data and lead to either smaller or larger apparent values than would be expected. Finally, an easily evaluated figure-of-merit is defined that may help guide more accurate Tauc fitting. For samples with relatively sharper Tauc plot shapes, the population yields Eg(ZnO) as 3.276 ± 0.033 eV, in good agreement with data for single crystalline material.},

abstract = {Accelerated life tests are frequently used to provide reliability information in a moderate period of time (weeks or months), and after that, a failure analysis is compulsory to detect the failure origins. In this paper, a failure analysis has been carried out after a temperature accelerated life test on lattice matched GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple junction commercial solar cells. Solar cells were forward biased in darkness inside three climatic chambers in order to emulate the photo-generated current under nominal working conditions (a concentration level of 820 suns). After the accelerated aging test, a characterization of the resulting cells by means of quantum efficiency, dark and illumination I–V curves, electroluminescence, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray, scanning transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been carried out. Current is identified as the cause of degradation while temperature just dominates the accelerating factor of the aging test. Current promotes the front metal damage produced by the chemical evolution of the electroplating impurities together with those of the tab soldering process. Semiconductor structure does not seem to be responsible of any failure. Therefore, this kind of lattice matched GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple junction solar cells, that as of 2016, are the workhorse of CPV technology, exhibits as a very robust device if the front metal connection is properly accomplished.

abstract = {(GaIn)(NAs) lattice matched to GaAs and Ge and having a 1 eV bandgap is a promising candidate for future space and terrestrial multi-junction solar cell structures. The present paper summarizes results of a detailed annealing study of the metastable quaternary alloy having an In content of 8{\%} and a N content of 2.8{\%}. It is shown that photoluminescence (PL) intensity can be taken as a measure of improving minority carrier characteristics in solar cell devices. A direct correlation between PL intensity and quantum efficiency in the (GaIn)(NAs) material system is observed. The annealing conditions, e.g. anneal temperature, time and As-stabilization, have to be adapted to the particular In content of the material in order to initiate the site change of the nitrogen atom from a Ga-rich environment upon growth to an In-rich one after annealing. In addition, the dissolution of chain-like N-ordering in [0 0 1] direction is detected. The greatly enhanced optical performance leads to an improved quantum efficiencies of the (GaIn)(NAs) solar cell material. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Next, a simplification assuming a one-dimensional (1-D) current flow is considered and a fully analytical model is obtained. Then, both models are compared and the applicability range of the 1-D approximation is established. The model is then applied to the analysis of the inverted square grid with several configurations for the external connections. Finally, the potential of the model is illustrated with a set of simulations carried out using a 1000{\&}times; concentrator GaAs solar cell and a number of conclusions of practical and technological interest are extracted.},

abstract = {NREL has been modeling U.S. photovoltaic (PV) system costs since 2009. This year, our report benchmarks costs of U.S. solar PV for residential, commercial, and utility- scale systems built in the first quarter of 2016 (Q1 2016). Costs are represented from the perspective of the developer/installer; thus all hardware costs represent the price at which components are purchased by the developer/installer. Importantly, the benchmark this year also represents the sales price paid to the installer; therefore, it includes profit in the cost of the hardware and the profit the installer/developer receives, as a separate cost category. However, it does not include any additional net profit, such as a developer fee or price gross-up, which are common in the marketplace. We adopt this approach owing to the wide variation in developer profits in all three sectors, where project pricing is highly dependent on region and project specifics such as local retail electricity rate structures, local rebate and incentive structures, competitive environment, and overall project/deal structures.},

abstract = {The extent and timing of cost-reducing improvements in low-carbon energy systems are important sources of uncertainty in future levels of greenhouse-gas emissions. Models that assess the costs of climate change mitigation policy, and energy policy in general, rely heavily on learning curves to include technology dynamics. Historically, no energy technology has changed more dramatically than photovoltaics (PV), the cost of which has declined by a factor of nearly 100 since the 1950s. Which changes were most important in accounting for the cost reductions that have occurred over the past three decades? Are these results consistent with the notion that learning from experience drove technical change? In this paper, empirical data are assembled to populate a simple model identifying the most important factors affecting the cost of PV. The results indicate that learning from experience, the theoretical mechanism used to explain learning curves, only weakly explains change in the most important factors—plant size, module efficiency, and the cost of silicon. Ways in which the consideration of a broader set of influences, such as technical barriers, industry structure, and characteristics of demand, might be used to inform energy technology policy are discussed.},

abstract = {Front-surface grid electrodes are employed in solar concentrator cells to reduce the power losses resulting from lateral current flow in the cell emitter. Because these electrodes also shadow the cell from a portion of the incident light, an optimal grid electrode layout must be determined for a particular cell design. A useful model for this optimization in the early stages of design is to simulate the distributed losses in the cell emitter using an equivalent lumped series resistance. Previously reported 1D analytical calculations showed that the equivalent resistance of one square should simply be one-third of the emitter sheet resistance. However, this calculation ignores local biasing loss. In this work, a quasi-3D model, which includes this local biasing effect, is used to extract an equivalent series resistance of a section of the emitter between grid electrodes for various sheet resistances and optical concentration.},

abstract = {Surface crosshatch roughness typically develops during the growth of lattice-mismatched compositionally graded buffers and can limit misfit dislocation glide. In this study, the crosshatch roughness during growth of a compressive GaInP/GaAs graded buffer is reduced by increasing the phosphine partial pressure throughout the metamorphic growth. Changes in the average misfit dislocation length are qualitatively determined by characterizing the threading defect density and residual strain. The decrease of crosshatch roughness leads to an increase in the average misfit dislocation glide length, indicating that the surface roughness is limiting dislocation glide. Growth rate is also analyzed as a method to reduce surface crosshatch roughness and increase glide length, but has a more complicated relationship with glide kinetics. Using knowledge gained from these experiments, high quality inverted GaInAs 1 eV solar cells are grown on a GaInP compositionally graded buffer with reduced roughness and threading dislocation density. The open circuit voltage is only 0.38 V lower than the bandgap potential at a short circuit current density of 15 mA/cm 2, suggesting that there is very little loss due to the lattice mismatch. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

In this paper, an improved 3D distributed model is presented that considers real operation regimes in a tunnel junction. This advanced model is able to accurately simulate the operation of the solar cell at high concentrations at which the photogenerated current surpasses the peak current of the tunnel junction. Simulations of dual-junction solar cells were carried out with the improved model to illustrate its capabilities and the results have been correlated with experimental data reported in the literature. These simulations show that, under certain circumstances, the solar cell's short circuit current may be slightly higher than the tunnel junction peak current without showing the characteristic dip in the J–V curve. This behavior is caused by the lateral current spreading toward dark regions, which occurs through the anode/p-barrier of the tunnel junction.},

abstract = {We compare the electroluminescence (EL) of polycrystalline ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2 heterojunction solar cells with similar band gaps but different open circuit voltages, indicating a difference in the electronic quality of the absorber. Temperature dependent EL measurements reveal that all cells feature transitions from donor-acceptor pair recombination at lower temperature to band to band recombination at higher temperatures. However, the less efficient cells show a longer transition range with donor-acceptor pair recombination still apparent at room temperature. We find further that the part of the room temperature spectrum that is due to band to band transitions in the respective cells is relatively broader than expected from a direct semiconductor with a homogeneous band gap. We analyze this spectral broadening by a model that accounts for band gap fluctuations of the absorber material. The experimental results show that the dominant part of this spectral broadening results from the intentional band gap grading and not from stochastic band gap fluctuations. We show further that the spectral EL emission is linked to the photovoltaic external quantum efficiency by electro-optical reciprocity. In a similar way, the external EL quantum efficiency is related to the open circuit voltage of the device. We verify experimentally that the difference between radiative and measured open circuit voltage determines the EL external quantum efficiency of the solar cell. The best Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell reaches an external light emitting diode quantum efficiency of around 0.1{\%}.},

abstract = {Dilute nitride GaInN(Sb)As with a band gap (Eg) of 1.0 eV is a promising material for the integration in next generation multijunction solar cells. We have investigated the effect of a compositionally graded GaInNAs absorber layer on the spectral response of a GaInNAs sub cell. We produced band gap gradings ($\Delta$Eg) of up to 39 meV across a 1 $\mu$m thick GaInNAs layer. Thereby, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) – compared to reference cells – was increased due to the improved extraction of photo-generated carriers from 34.0 {\%} to 36.7 {\%} for the wavelength range from 900 nm to 1150 nm. However, this device figure improvement is accompanied by a small decrease in the open circuit voltage (VOC) of about 20 mV and the shift of the absorption edge to shorter wavelengths.},

abstract = {The electronic and atomic structure of substitutional nitrogen pairs, triplets, and clusters in GaP and GaAs is studied using the multiband empirical pseudopotential method with atomistically relaxed supercells. A single nitrogen impurity creates a localized a/sub 1/(N) gap state in GaP, but in GaAs, the state is resonant above the conduction-band minimum. We show how the interaction of multiple a/sub 1/ impurity levels, for more than one nitrogen, results in a nonmonotonic relationship between energy level and impurity separation. We assign the lowest (NN1) line in GaP to a [2,2,0] oriented pair, the second (NN2) line to a triplet of nitrogen atoms, and identify the origin of a deeper observed level as an [1,1,0] oriented triplet. We also demonstrate that small nitrogen clusters readily create very deep levels in both GaP and GaAs.},

Quite accurate models have been developed in the past that reproduce the experimental data of single-junction solar cells very closely. These models help in the determination of the origin of the peculiarities of the dark and one sun or high concentration experimental I{\&}{\#}x2013;V curves. They also allow the design of the front grid, the analysis of the impact of the electrical parameters of the solar cell on the performance of the final device, etc. In this work, these models are used to study the effect of non-uniform profiles, generated by the concentrator optics, on the performance of a concentrator solar cell. The design of the front grid is then optimized to minimize the losses introduced by the light distribution, even taking into account the effect of the tracking system misalignment. As an introductory application example of multijunction solar cells analysis with this kind of modeling, the effect of the chromatic aberration on a double junction solar cell is presented.},

abstract = {This paper re-examines the impact of atmospheric absorption bands on series-connected multijunction cell design, motivated by the numerous local efficiency maxima that appear as the number of junctions is increased. Some of the local maxima are related to the bottom subcell bandgap and are already well understood: As the bottom subcell bandgap is varied, a local efficiency maximum is produced wherever the bottom cell bandgap crosses an atmospheric absorption band. The optimal cell designs at these local maxima are generally current matched, such that all subcells have nearly the same short-circuit current. Here, we systematically describe additional local maxima that occur wherever an upper subcell bandgap encounters an atmospheric absorption band. These local maxima are not current matched and become more prevalent as the number of junctions increases, complicating the solution space for five-junction and six-junction designs. A systematic framework for describing this complexity is developed, and implications for numerical convergence are discussed.},

Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with or without a layer of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and were studied without encapsulation. Photovoltaic performance characteristics were measured as a function of time for different ambient conditions (under white light irradiation and in the dark, and under air, dry oxygen and humid nitrogen atmospheres). It was found that a key cause of degradation under air exposure is light independent and results from water adsorption by the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer. Measurements of the charge mobility and hole injection after air exposure showed that the degradation increases the resistance of the PEDOT:PSS/blend layer interface. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper discusses semiconductor device research paths under investigation with the aim of reaching the milestone efficiency of 40{\%}. A cost analysis shows that achieving very high cell efficiencies is crucial for the realization of cost-effective photovoltaics, because of the strongly leveraging effect of efficiency on module packaging and balance-of systems costs. Lattice- matched (LM) GaInP/ GaInAs/ Ge 3-junction cells have achieved the highest independently confirmed efficiency at 175 suns, 25°C, of 37.3{\%} under the standard AM1.5D, low-AOD terrestrial spectrum. Lattice- mismatched, or metamorphic (MM), materials offer still higher potential efficiencies, if the crystal quality can be maintained. Theoretical efficiencies well over 50{\%} are possible for a MM GaInP/ 1.17-eV GaInAs/ Ge 3- junction cell limited by radiative recombination at 500 suns. The bandgap – open circuit voltage offset, (Eg/q) – Voc, is used as a valuable theoretical and experimental tool to characterize multijunction cells with subcell bandgaps ranging from 0.7 to 2.1 eV. Experimental results are presented for prototype 6-junction cells employing an active {\~{}}1.1-eV dilute nitride GaInNAs subcell, with active-area efficiency greater than 23{\%} and over 5.3 V open-circuit voltage under the 1-sun AM0 space spectrum. Such cell designs have theoretical efficiencies under the terrestrial spectrum at 500 suns concentration exceeding 55{\%} efficiency, even for lattice- matched designs.},

abstract = {A model for the formation energy of In–N clusters in InxGa1−xNyAs1−y alloys is developed. It is found that when the number of In atoms bonded to one N atom reaches 2.7, the lattice constant in the neighborhood of N atoms matches that of GaAs and the local strain decreases to the minimum. The relationship among the spectral blueshift, the formation energy of one In–N bond, the average number of nearest-neighbor In atoms per N atom, and the nitrogen level is also discussed. It is helpful to further investigate the relationship between the spectral blueshift and the annealing parameters.},

abstract = {This paper presents average values of levelized costs for generating technologies entering service in 2018, 2022, 1 and 2040 as represented in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) for the Annual Energy Outlook 2016 (AEO2016) Reference case. 2 The levelized costs for generating technologies entering service in 2022 are presented in the body of the report, with those for 2018 3 and 2040 included in Appendices A and B, respectively. Both a capacity-weighted average based on projected capacity additions across the 22 U.S. regions of the NEMS electricity market module and a simple average of the regional values are provided, together with the range of regional values. Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and its limitations Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competiveness of different generating technologies. It represents the per-kilowatthour cost (in real dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle. Key inputs to calculating LCOE include capital costs, fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance (O{\&}M) costs, financing costs, and an assumed utilization rate for each plant type. 4 The importance of the factors varies among the technologies. For technologies such as solar and wind generation that have no fuel costs and relatively small variable O{\&}M costs, LCOE changes in rough proportion to the estimated capital cost of generation capacity. For technologies with significant fuel cost, both fuel cost and overnight cost estimates significantly affect LCOE. The availability of various incentives, including state or federal tax credits, can also impact the calculation of LCOE. As with any projection, there is uncertainty about all of these factors and their values can vary regionally and across time as technologies evolve and fuel prices change. It is important to note that actual plant investment decisions are affected by the specific technological and regional characteristics of a project, which involve numerous other factors not reflected in LCOE values. The projected utilization rate, which depends on the load shape and the existing resource mix in an area where additional capacity is needed, is one such factor. The existing resource mix in a region can directly impact the economic viability of a new investment through its effect on the economics},

@article{VanderHeide2009,
abstract = {This paper describes the realisation of cost-efficient thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells based on germanium substrates. Because the majority of the photons incident on the TPV cell in a typical TPV system will have a long wavelength it is important to apply optical confinement in the TPV cell. In this paper this has been done by using a highly reflective rear contact. Electrical contact at the rear has been created with a laser (laser fired contact, LFC) such that the metal is locally heated and contact is formed. The optimal TPV cell is based on a low doped (1 × 1015cm- 3)p -type germanium substrate having a 500 nm thick n-type emitter (1 × 1019cm- 3), where front and rear are both passivated with hydrogen rich PECVD amorphous silicon. An AM1.5G record efficiency has been measured for a germanium TPV cell with an LFC rear contact. The application of optical confinement leads to a clear improvement of the spectral response in the wavelength region which is dominant in TPV systems and results in a potential 20{\%} increase of current density compared to the use of a classical germanium photovoltaic cell. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Steiner2012,
abstract = {We analyze the quantum efficiency measurement of a series-connected multijunction solar cell by modeling the cell as an ac resistive-capacitive circuit and studying the complex current as a function of the light biasing. The photocurrent induced by directly absorbed photons is modeled as an independent current source, whereas the luminescent coupling current from higher bandgap to lower bandgap subcells is modeled as a dependent current source in the bottom subcell. We derive expressions for the equivalent impedance and the complex current in measurements of the top and bottom subcells of a two-junction device. High light biasing of the nonlimiting cell drives the magnitude and phase shift of the current toward well-defined limits, but insufficient light biasing yields a composite response that is not fully characteristic of either subcell. We recommend that the experimenter always monitor the phase shift of the signal for signs of insufficient light biasing, and to help identify genuine luminescent coupling effects.},

abstract = {Ca impurities are observed in GaInNAs grown by both molecular-beam epitaxy and metal organic chemical-vapor deposition by high-mass-resolution secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements. The Ca appears to originate from the surface of the as-received GaAs substrates, and presumably comes from the polishing process used in substrate preparation. Ca was observed in samples grown by different growth methods and in different laboratories. No detectable Ca incorporates into epitaxialGaAs, although Ca levels as high as 10 17 cm − 3 are observed in GaInNAs. There are indications that the Ca impurities act as shallow acceptors in GaInNAs and may, at least in part, control the background acceptor concentrations. This has implications for high-current, p - i - n GaInNAs solar cells that require very low background doping to enhance current collection.},
